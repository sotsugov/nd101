Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
There.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
The "real you".
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hi, Joey.
You are so completely unbalanced.
You did what?
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
Patrick -- is that- a.
Wear the belly before you go.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
So -- which Dakota you from?
How many people were in your old school?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Away.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
We don't chat.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Have you seen him?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You're not a big talker, are you?
You know who The Raincoats are?
No, you weren't
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Who?
Unwelcome.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
No what?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
Wait I...
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
You don't usually ask.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Father...
No...
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Passion is something one cannot control!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
He must be replaced.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
I was all of these.
What's your cut?  How much?
What else do you need?
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
I will if they don't send me back.
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
In the kitchen.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
End my career?
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
You goin' to the escort service?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
So what's unique?
Keep them out of my way.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Turn that fucking thing off!
Whore?
I did.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Ha. Ha.
A job?
Robert...?
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
What are you coming here to do?
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
He knew all along.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
What the hell happened?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Yes?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
But not completely inconceivable?
I guess it isn't.
Good morning. How's it going?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Well, don't worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Any clue as to what it is?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
I'm candy...
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
You okay?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Hey, you're right.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Hello.
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
Shut up.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Five.  On credit.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
We have to save the world.
Of course.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
How do I look?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Other than that... You all right?
...Ma???
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
You know how to fly this thing?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Why not?
It's my wife.
Apipoulai!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The cash man!
Been here long?
Talk English Doc.
This thing solid?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Hello?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
What you see is what I got, mister.
Dino...
Machine.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
What?
What the fuck are you.. ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
You enjoy it?
I never killed anyone.
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
How long you been working there?
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Wha... ?
My condolences.
I'm afraid I don't...
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Do you know what happened to her?
Her belongings?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay, I'll take it all.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You're his sister, right?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
How long have you been awake?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Feeling better now?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Very funny.
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
But how are we gonna --
They think I'm nuts.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Seems to be all around...
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Anything ---
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
You heard the news.
We bought you.
You think so.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I used to play ball.
They said.
Yeah.
How'd you get the job?
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You stayed away?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What are you talking about?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
Where's the plow?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
I'm fine, fine.
On what you pay me?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
I'm sorry.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Of course! I would've heard.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
There's a furnace.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Twombley.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Get some sleep.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
How you doing, sweetie?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
How we doing, Colonel?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
But they start executing hostages in
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
About goddamn time.
Nine.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Stand by.
I know he left you behind.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
What?
What are you doing?
One.
But...
Yeah, right.
Other way around, sir.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Shit.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Set!
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Maybe.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
That's right.
I love you, Elaine.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
See them, Elaine?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Yes.
Get the picture?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
I believe he is probably lying.
You are married?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
In the other man's rectum.
Well, let's roll, George.
What was that about?
How potent?
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
But there's no more drug.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
The human?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
I get the picture.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
What is it?
How do you feel?
Sir?
Save it.
The corner!  Ready?
They'll get us.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Fuck you.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
I knew you'd come.
Are we going to sleep now?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Where?
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Don't bother!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Why not?
Em iram! Em iram!
No!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What's the matter with you?
No!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Well, ask her!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Why not? Half the house!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
These are originals?
But! I'm a married woman!
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
He's doing his best.
Be careful!
Behold!
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
What a charming idea. May I see?
A-flat, Majesty.
And the result satisfies.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
How is your financial situation?
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many?
No, really!
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
What?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Madame.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
How could I not?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
I can't say. Really
Really? Why?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
What dead? Who is dead?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How long will you give me?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
We ended in F Major?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
What for?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
About what?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Do you hear me?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Herr Salieri.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
And what else?
Surely you're not suggesting...
What shall we do?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Could you get here without any trouble?
No, a cab will be faster.
Call me Alex.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Will you come with me?
Will you think about it?
I'm a werewolf.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
But, David.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Some, everyone does.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Did you see Jack?
Are you cold?
Yes.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
That's a wolf's head.
Nice looking group.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
It's moving.
You really scared me, you shithead.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
David!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Because this must be stopped.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
No.
Sorry.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
How much?
Let me have ten bucks?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't you know?
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Why, Matt!
Now?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Good morning.
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Dickson?
Why, I don't know.
It's all right. Thanks.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Why?
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
They must have turned him down.
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes.
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
This is the best score yet.
I swear --
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Damn!
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
What?
I could use the walk.
I got seven thousand.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Both would be nice.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What is it?
Distracting enough for you?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I figure.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
That just might work.
You can shut up now.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
And what's this right girl like?
Sparkling rocks?
Zee.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Mmm.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
And you're too young.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
This time we'll make an exception.
Really?
There's only four of them...
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
This is Dorsia?
Why?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
But what about the past? Our past?
You're inhuman.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It looks so soft.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Like what?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Patrick?
Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Why?
A model? An actor?
Well.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
No. I'm okay.
KIMBALL.
No, really. I'm okay.
Shoot.
How old are you?
What?
No.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm so hungry.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Al.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Hey, Halberstam?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
Isn't that -- extreme?
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
What?
Milo?
Right... What's that mean again?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
...Do I?
How's it going?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I --
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Who can we trust?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Oh.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Does he know you know?
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What're they building?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
When do I begin?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
That does not compute.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Let's go get him!
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Lay it on me.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Dr. Evil?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Why?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
We don't judge here.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Would that I could say the Same.
Have we met?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
I resign.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
I didn't. Mother did.
As per mother's instructions.
Strange.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
But
This must be the last straw.
No trouble.
And do you trust me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Not for a moment.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Our chaperon.
Where's Mother?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Global warming?
Steed
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Both, actually.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Nice shot.
I've tried to change her mind.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
It looks awful.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Huh? Wha...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Let's get naked.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Your whores never showed up.
It's true.
Yes.
You're a pimp?
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
I just want to be alone.
You okay?
Really?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where'd she go?
What's the matter?
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
How'd it go?
Who?
My Debbie?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Did you do it for Tim?
I like what you've done with the place.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I'll handle it.
I work for city hall.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Okay.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- I work for the city.
Then who --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Are you still here?
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
I'm busy.
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
-- Burn them.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Who?
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
All right, cop. I want my money.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Are you sure?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
What's your name?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
I would like to change your name.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm feelin' dis'!
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
How was it?
You okay?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
What is this?
A gift.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Yes, your name?
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
You feel good, not nervous?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Peerless, your father called.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
You tellin' the truth.
Not her, the one with the little...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...yes she did.
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
I feel a song a comin' on.
Y'know what?
What?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Why don't you answer?
Good morning.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
And so I am.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I don't know.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
No.
Never.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
You want my heart?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Why are you shaking?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Was he cheated?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I beg your pardon?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
I don't want to go --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
I didn't shoot West --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Right?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Why?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
But you didn't.
Why did he come back for you?
Something funny, Levi?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
What I said before --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Why?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Why do you care?
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No bodies, no West...
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What are you doing out here?
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Your phone number?
What are you talking about?
Pike, please --
Poor fucker my ass...
So you took off your shirt?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
Pike never confessed.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Yeah.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Yes.
I have to leave. Tonight.
I brought it.
Can I see him?
Yeah.
So I've heard.
That's terrible.
You were talking about your wedding.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Am I?
What did he say?
You mean, while I'm here.
Did I ever tell you about how...
What?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
It's unbelievable.
Oh.
They're your favorite flower.
Really.
So what are you up to now?
Oh. Oh.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
I'm going to check on him.
But it's not true.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How is he?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
What?
What? What are you doing?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Hello.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants a lot of money.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
What's wrong?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You don't understand anything.
So what are you going to do?
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
You don't understand me.
You don't have to say anything
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
No.
No.
Why?
Just wanted to see.
Yeah, I know.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Like a man.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Two days?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Don't need none.
Let me say somethin' first...
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
We drinkin' buddies now?
By myself?
Sorry.
I don't want you to let go.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
I'm a what?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
This should be it...
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Give me a break, would you?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Give us a break...
Know her?
What's he saying?
Ichiro --
I'm not drunk...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
What...?  Why?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Start it.
You did great, Ichiro.
Thank you.  You have one?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
We're in?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
He was my partner.
I want a gun.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
I want him.
Good.
What's the problem?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Why are you staring at us?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
You're our best and only friend.
What's going on down there?
I think, therefore I am.
Industrial refuse.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
One more, eh?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Jeezus!
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Is there anything else?
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Who is this?
Where is he?
How are you doing?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Like?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
But then how can you...
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
They left.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Twenty.
Hi!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
My office.
Well, that depends...
Where are we going?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
No.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
You said it would be easy!
Is this your house?
Um-hum.
May I please be excused?
Hey, Eve!
Do I look crazy?
Not that one!
What about her?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Eve?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
What?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Really?  Okay!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Are you all right?
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
These are wonderful.
Well, do we just go on up?!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
That's what everybody believes?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Why did you park way back there?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Up there!!
Say what?!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Oh, my God!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
No.  They all do.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
If we still have one.
Well, I am the head of this household--
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Alright, I will.
I think...it...works.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Eve?!
He go back to the hotel?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Where did he get all that information?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Adam!!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No, not at all.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Do you like that?
Thank you. honey.
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I, uh.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Falling.
Come in.
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Sometimes I think I do.
You what?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I want you to stay with me.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Who, Dorothy?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
No. No thank you.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Terrible boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, thanks.
Actually. I've been in twice.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Look under the body.
What?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Destroy all that which is evil...
What?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Where's my cat?
So what are you thinkin' here?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Who were the victims?
Right now.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
No. You sure you're okay?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
He says. This is he.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
It had an alarm.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
There's another stocker, right?
Yeah.
Why not?
Yes, they are.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
May I have a word with you, please?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
She's from Cuba.
See, now we've got a plan.
He's gone. He stole the car.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Our money situation is not good.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
Do you like Inez?
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Freeze!
Help me move him.
I don't know.
He did?
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
You think Applejack knew?
Why?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
What's he in for?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What do you mean?
Why'd you want to help us?
Who?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Are you serious?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
What?  What?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
No.
They are.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
How long has he been in there?
Don't threaten me, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Not bad.
You said 48 hours!
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Where's Applejack?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
I'm working on it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
Oh, yeah.
Is he good?
What's the story?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
No. I just have short hair.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
I don't know.
What?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
What do you mean?
Save it for Bourne.
...this is Conklin's computer.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Berlin!
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
What do you have, Danny?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
You know I'm not.
I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
What do you want?
Conklin.
What's going on in Berlin?
-- car keys?
Sleep. Sleep now.
I should be better by now.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Why is she trying to kill me?
My first job.
I was here!
Where am I?
You didn't answer my question.
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Good luck.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
So he fooled you.
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Longshanks promised!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's followers.
I'll wait... back there.
I rest.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
You win.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
Good to see you again.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
You scare me.
Then when?
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
We're gonna be late again.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Sure...
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
I thought you were a December baby.
I deserve a lot worse.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Not if you remember my dad.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Where are we going?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I don't get it.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Then you think it might have worked out?
What time is it?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
And you are...?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
A franc for your thoughts.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Yes, of course, we --
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Ask me?
He came from Paris with Rick.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
And I congratulate you.
My office.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes.
I understand.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
My bill.
I slept very well.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Yes.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
This is hardly the time or the place.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Ho, diplomatist!
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Is that a serious offer?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Yeah? Why?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Our expenses?
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are my eyes really brown?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No more water, you said.
Take it, damn it.
You're putting off the inevitable.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Chuck.
He is a cute thing.
This isn't working out.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
If I'd known you were alive --
What's that?
There was a coffin?
What was inside?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
You okay?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
You too.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Really?
When'd you start working here?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
It's me.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's what it's about.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
Dr. Homer Wells.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
So, Mrs...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I better go.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
What's the *medical* explanation?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
At least you were never lonely.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I'm okay--I can walk.
There! You said it was boring.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Migrants?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
I don't think so.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
But you don't look very happy.
That's *it*?
That's it.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
So we go to the bar.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
You know what we're doing with the money.
How much we going after?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I --
Attractive girl.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Mr. King, I think --
What?
Lighten up.
WHAT?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
King ain't gonna like this.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
In over your head?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Who?
That's what I'm talking about.
I can imagine.
Who was he?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
I don't like it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Here...use a spoon.
Found a job?
No.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I've lived there.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
In the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Absolutely not.
How did you hurt your hand?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
I want you to forget what I said.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Did you solve your problems?
Who...
Ross.
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
And the girls?
Does Bella come here?
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Oh. What's wrong now?
Key? Key? What is the key?
All right, then...
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
This is fun.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Fred.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I need a diameter approximation.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Doolittle, hello?
Talk to the bomb.
Who are you?
Yeah.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You mean until you showed up?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
Yes on all counts.
You need to get out more.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
How well do you remember the lab?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
A girl.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Know where I can find her?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You're also a fool.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Got a pencil?
Straight.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A little what?
Not right now.
What if he's on the level?
Tell everybody hey.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
No problem.
Sorry.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Ann Arbor?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Cool.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Yeah.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Is that your final answer?
Yeah.
Are you AFRAID?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
I didn't say shit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Do they know yet?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Why should we care?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What is her name?
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Nothing.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yes.
How is that possible?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
That's enough.
It is a big deal.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
You-betcha.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Oh, Amber...
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh shit!
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
What?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Yeah...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
You could be quiet.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
My dress'll reek.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Yeah.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Lester?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
This is -- what?
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
He should be king!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Take a letter.
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes, sir. 
Hey you!!
I don't want him.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Anything else? 
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Give me that again!
Once more! 
Bah!! 
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Your Excellency!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
I found it.
What are you going to do?
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
What happened?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Good morning, sir.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
I feel much better. Thank you.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Good day...!
Oh no?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
y-y-yes--
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Thank you... very much.
What's this?
...Yyes
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Who are they of?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Fine.
The workhouse.
Won't come out, eh?
Watery headed bunch.
Yes sir.  What's that?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
WHAT did you say?
What are what?
Yes.
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
It was different...
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
We mustn't let him land!
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Of course.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Would you like us to sing to you?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Don't talk nonsense.
Is there something the matter with it?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Why should WE care?
Row!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
ROW!
Bye, Leif.
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
Are you all right?
Aaagh!
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Sh! Hurry!
YOU do it!
Help!
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Yes, Mother.
Thanks, guys.
I did. You said, things were fine.
In the room?
Oh, Tangerine.
Why?
Why what?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
That's okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
You like that?
You just say. I'm not really --
No. I --
Yeah, I guess.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
You'll call me, right?
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Yo ho ho!
Let me drive you home.
Such a beautiful view.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
There's this guy!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
I scoured the city for it.
Yeah.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I know.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think we should go.
So go.
Make love?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It's true.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I don't know. Panties and --
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
That's me.
It's them.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Yeah.
What's this?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Alexander Pope?
Well, where was Patrick?
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
It's an apartment.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
I know who you are.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
What do you think?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
What guy?
Why? Why do you have to go?
Going north?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Your ranch?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Will it work?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Is that an offer?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
Does he know that?
This is Weir.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
We've got pressure.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Alive?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
Explanation?
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
What about my ship?
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
We don't have time to fart.
What is it, Smith?
Oxygen is not the problem.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Claire...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Claire is your wife?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Isn't that your speech?
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Hey! That's a prototype!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
And if he's not...?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
I understand the business reasons.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Easy, mon.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
They're not home yet.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
She's in my biology class.
No.
No. It's too soon.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I would. Yeah.
Damone, are you there?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Just be glad you're all right.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
But what are you going to do?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
I don't know. I guess so.
If you graduate.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Aren't your parents asleep?
I don't know.
Where's Mike today?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
He wanted the pineal gland.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Hell, no!
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
I want to leave fast.
When does this thing stop?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Yes!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The airport is over there!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
We'll meet in three hours?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Where's the tunnel?
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Ohhh.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
But --
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Sure.
What? Really?
What?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Bullshit.
Gimme the keys.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
And the last one is the...
Okay, well that's something.
Let's go!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Her name is Charlie.
Did we make it?
Um, well...
What did we say about lying?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Putting on my armor.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
What's up?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
There've been some calls.
...Yes.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Bye, baby.
I know.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Fifteen.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
Are you an actor?
They'll mend.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Whattaya mean?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Quietly.
...So you think I should go.
You don't know what you want.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Harry... I met someone.
Yeah.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
You're telling me.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Think I'll have a glass.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
And?
Evening, gorgeous.
I guess.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Where to?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Fine!
What happened? Who're you?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Why are these all opened?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Yes, Mama.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Please sit down...
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Nice.
Better that way... for me.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
So have I
What kind of God is He to will this?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
I wish to be your husband.
Our decision. Together.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Why the change? What about your work?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Henry Clerval.
Quite a few.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
You can't. Death is God's will!
A... week?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Alice.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
It sounded like Brenda.
What is it?
Roll him over!
You just had some lucky shots.
Jack?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Another coincidence.
Why do you want to stop?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
What's your name?
Where is the little lady?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why not, against your religion?
To your family.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
No!
Not many.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Hot goddamn day!
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Whatsamatter?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Gotcha!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Sight seein'.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Where are you right now?
It don't look together.
The woman I saw you with...
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
See me, sir?
Sir?  What did he say?
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Yes?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'm sure it is.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Just do it, okay?
Come on, Montgomery...
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
"In Washington..."
I'd sure like to know who.
They had to kill 'em?
You got anybody, Wick?
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Do you, uh, know...
Permission to get dressed, sir?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
That why you dumped him?
You okay?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Call me Charlie.
I can't.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Not for a long time, now.
It's Tatopoulos.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
What are you suggesting?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I think we should leave now.
Just don't.
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
"The show must go on."
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
You go first! There's no time!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
What the hell is going on?!!?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Alex you can't -just leave.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
We heard it the first time!
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Systems register functional.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Only answers to me.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
JASON...
Clenched jaw...
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Right.
Gwen...
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
We pretend...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Wh... Where are we?
How about the pig-lizard?
Because they're coming right at us.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Arnold!
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Yes, general.
No.  I guess.
Yes, my lord.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
How old are you, Captain?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
To hell with Arnold...
What's your advice, Alexander?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Makes you gag.
Partially...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Colonel Reed...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I... they look both the same.
General Lee, sir!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
I want you to see our hospital.
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Or, 'civilized'.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Let's get you darker!
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
I reserved a Cadillac.
You're kidding me, right?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You see the paper?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
I need the money.
What money?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
I'll find it.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Depends. Who's this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
He owes me money.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
I want you to.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Maybe a few times I have.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
You have it?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
One of mine?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
Who told you that?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Right. See how your story ends.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Then you've read it?
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
You thought I was faking?
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
I don't know.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Pick 'n' Save.
What a spectacular view.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Harry -–
Really.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
How about now?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Let's not be too hasty.
What is it?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Three, four days.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Went aboard.
Sounds like the hull.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What the fuck -- ?
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
You okay?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Coffee?
What'd you find up there?
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Victims of what?
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Epps? You there?
We hit land.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Yeah.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
What now?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
YES.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
...wow...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Do you want something to drink?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Why?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Hi, Al!
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Hey - why do you have this?
Look at how cute I am!
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Gross!
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Not really...
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
What was that all about?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Don't worry.
No, really...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Just some people from work...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
So, whaddya think?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Seymour does.
What?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
A dollar seventy-five.
Oops! I dropped it!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
So is that your boyfriend?
I - I'd really rather not...
Relax, Seymour, relax...
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Wow!  What was that all about?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
Uh... sure... come in.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
What?
I dunno, I...
What do you want?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Please Josh?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
There is no reason for fear.
Starting now, we attack them.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
And it worked?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
Second death? Where?-
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Do you love her?
You've known him long?
How many cattle?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Egon!
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
What's your story, Pete?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Out!
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Are you Peter Venkman?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
May I please see the storage facility?
Yes?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
I'm always serious.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Don't cross the beams.
All right.  I'll try.
She said he was "the Destructor."
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Looked at with your eyes.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Where have you been?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
I am their hero!
Then you'd be out of a job.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Take grain away from the army?
Marcus Aurelius has died.
I don't know...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Where are they?
They fear me.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
He's very realistic.
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Yes.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Aren't you eating?
Why not?
No -- why should I?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Was she married or something?
Yes.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Don't cry. 
At the Zoo.
I don't understand --
What did she say?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
My belt.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I don't know.
Yes.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
What did you do to her?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Mr. McCleery?
I'm putting it on the top step.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Did you get a room?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Will you come in, please?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
No.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Jesus Christ!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
He didn't see me.
Do you want to?
The number.
Thank you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Are you afraid of me?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Can I take off my clothes now?
What novel did you read.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
I walk out.
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
About five years.
No.
How many times a year.
Not exactly.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
And you were a student also.
Well how did it happen?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
Let's drop it.
You're not.
May I stay then?
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
What?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
You believe me, don't you?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
You got me.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
I've got to go.
Oh no.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Yes?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
No --
With the pearls?
I've quit.
You can't.
Oh!
Reducing?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
You're very funny --
We'll dance.
Why do you hide in my room?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
No?
And what do you do -- now?
I'll not denounce you.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Shall I see you again?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Till then.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
The Baron is tired?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
We could come to my room.
That was my last.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Good heavens. What for?
Oh!
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Please -- please!
What's the matter?
I didn't like Preysing right off.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Movies?
No.
Definitely off.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
You're sweet.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
You've decided against the merger?
Then, it's all over?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Shall I tell them again?
I can't dance tonight --
Oh, yes, Suzette.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
I could not think of not accepting.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
We will wait.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
What's the matter with you?
That.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You know it, Lilly.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
What? Me?
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Don't mention it.
I like those.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Bluebell came in?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Myra followed you, huh?
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Uh-huh.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
For God's sake, Lilly!
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
I didn't teach you that.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
Is that right?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
No question, huh?
Mr. Simms.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Carter.
Do you know who did this?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
What the fuck are you talking about?
You sure?
My office?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Where'd you get it?
Why not?
Then I'll get caught.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Better?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
It's John, isn't it?
Are you going to leave, too?
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Danny?!  Danny!
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Samhain.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
A bitch.
Home, sweet home.
How all the magazines show tits today.
You know what gets me?
Can I have the Cadillac?
Go home.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You ever own a motorcycle?
The educational process.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
The posies are for her?
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Sir?
Excellent!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Can't it keep till morning?
The smallest thing I've got.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
"Hamburger Heaven."
Sir?
I'm engaged.
Not at all.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
We thought a doctor might help.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Shouldn't you lie down?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Such as?...
The doctor.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Rifle?
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
Blue soup?
Like what?
You're begging him to kill you?
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I thought she was a widow.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
Poison.
Don Quixote.
No!
Don't shoot.
Leave the rifle here.
You don't know?
And you went home unannounced, too?
For what?
What happened?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I heard you were looking for me.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Don't touch me.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Where will you be?
Is Norbert still here?
No.
That man is your father.
What does he say to do?
Then get him.
It's fine!
Yes?
Something happens to my confidence.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Is he coming home?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
We made the date three months ago.
What?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
I'm amazed.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No. I don't think so.
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Are you sure it's all right?
No.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
'Sucking off.'
But it's all you do.
What's T-J?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Fuck.
More or less.
It's not quite the same thing.
What makes you so sure?
She left you right?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Granville?
So then, Mr. Mast...
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Where'd you hear that name?
It's just a name.
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Wes, do me a favor.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I thought you were a businessman.
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
You never heard of that?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Huh?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
None of that, lady.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Here's your shovel.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Harold Chasen.
Eh, no.
Your hearse?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Look.
What is it?
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Did Confucius say that?
Don't you advance on me.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Like a tea ceremony?
Why?
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Your classmates?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Parasite!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Frank.
He... he loved me.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Kyle, you don't have...
Well... G'bye.
I... remember.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Do you believe in hell?
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How does he know so much about me?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Well, you did break out --
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Those things never work. Never.
Don't move. We --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Not from you.
Are you sure about this?
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
He -- loves you.
What -- ?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
No time for argument.
Please. Get back into bed.
I don't remember.
That's right. Who are you?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well?
Back from where?
...somebody...
Hurting.
A box?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
So where's the harm?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Kirsty.
Hi. I got soaked.
Kirsty? It's very late.
What's the problem?
I was here this afternoon.
No, damn you --
Like who?
Just a thought --
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
So what's the argument?
Larry....
Who was it?
What are you drinking?
Plain soda?
You want something to drink?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Well I want you to see the house.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I want to see.
I won't be able to stand.
All right.  No. That's nice.
I've been better.
You gotta be kidding me.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Why would they care?
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
No way.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna.
May I help you?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
What do you mean, four more?
Is that it?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Are you all right?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
Just the obvious stuff.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I suppose so.
You won't like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I guess.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
I'm sure.
You still together?  Going all right?
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Mmnn.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
What about Ian?
Mission accomplished.
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
Nothing.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Not in love, exactly, but...
No.  Probably not.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
It's a great song.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Are you okay?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
So you'll stay?
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Doesn't have a head, does he?
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
I don't follow you.
You have an active imagination.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'd rather hear yours.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Who are you?
You kill with your left hand?
What is it you want?
Will I see you again?
The inheritance.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
You know me home.  Me name.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Yes.  Always.
It is as you are.
This is madness!
This can't be.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Why?
Me arm hurts.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
And you?
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
David.
Tradition.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Equals?
It can be different.  It must be.
Your father must be smart.
Where!
I don't know.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
And the Bulgarian?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Spare a chair?
Kahn?
How are you?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
I knew his great-grandfather.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Tradition.
No.
Do you know what this is?
I presume it's a sword.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
All I need is time.
You're a kind man to be sure.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Who is it?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Yes!
How's business, Bruce?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
You've had a better offer, eh?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Then what does he want with you?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
We're not interested.
What tricks would I pull?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Is he coming back here?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Well -- what is it?
Thanks.
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Walter!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
There's money in it, Cooley.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
So have we!
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Where is he?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Pure politics!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Have you got my dough?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Don't talk too loud.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Are you all right, now?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
The door was locked.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
You wouldn't.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What about it?
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
No Turks.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Has Sue got it right?
You joined up.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
He always knows.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
I wish it could all have been different.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Thank you.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
I'll help ya.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
I gotta open the gate.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Tickets for what?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
So.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Sleeping.
No please, let me sit this one out.
You got to be fucking joking.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Where's Bill?
Who's your Daddy!
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Tell him, Harold.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Is everything fine?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I am sleepy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Urgh.
Well, I think...
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Please let me go with you.
You what?
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
As do I.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
How's it going?
It looks wonderful.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
That's very funny.
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
He looks perfectly fine.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm just preoccupied.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
I had sold my fucking soul.
Should I come with?
So he's doing okay?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Yahoo!
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You want a chaser?
Huh?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
No, I'm fine.
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Do we need words?
Are you ready for another?
Could be.
Will you take a check, Bert?
How much do I owe you?
I'm buyin'.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
I told you. I got drunk.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
How good is he?
What's that supposed to mean?
Here, I got it.
Hey, Findley's here.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
You name it, we shoot it.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Talk to me, Charlie.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Yeah, that's what I think.
When?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
How much you playin' for?
Have a nice trip.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
Who is it?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Very good shot.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
Who is this?
Yes.
Have you always had it?
Do you still want me to stay?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
What did it look like?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Are you all right, Dad?
I left it at work.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Is that all he said?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
We were having a little talk.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
They'll get us.
No one comes here after dark.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
You're being paranoid.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
Did it work?
Love was never our problem.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can you believe this?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
That signal. It's a countdown.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Really? You don't mind?
Yes, I am.
No. Exotic.
Damn it!
But I gave you some this morning.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Can they be killed?
Here... now.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Your treat.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
How's the head?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Henry, the pen --
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Where did this come from?
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
I'm through!
Yes?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
It's important!
Well, what was left of him.
No! Don't Shoot!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad?
Dad?!
After you, Junior.
That was seven hundred years ago.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
That was a misunderstanding.
What does it mean, Indy?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
PET IT??!!
Primitive sexual practices?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A fulcrum release lever!
No... they won't kill me.
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
No, not her. Me.
Me.
Yes.
Why don't we go home?
No.
I just went there for a job.
Kill myself.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Why not?
Oh...Gooood!
Outrun them.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Go out, take your first left.
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
What about money?
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach.
The beach?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Eat it.
What? What do you mean?
She's...pretty fast.
Which language?
Without your pants.
It worked.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
What did that cost?
What glasses.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
I don't know what's going on.
How do you know?
This just won't work.
Not her. You!
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
What am I supposed to do?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
You been had. We have.
What do I do?
Just stay here and rest.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
I've got an idea.
haka xuki.
Are you alright?
He aready made the deal..
Do something.
What happened?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
You're a lucky man.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
You just got a Mickey.
What kind of a deal?
They have stolen state property.
How about a deal?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
I don't want to intrude.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
Well what?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Where?
You again.
Why?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Disinterest?
Is that Ryuji?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
This business is over.
One chip?
Hiroshima.
What?
I know the territory.
So do I.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Why not, what are you going to do?
I'll come back for you.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
That's twenty feet high.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ow?...
It doesn't hurt.
It'l take months.
Three hours.
Sure. Where?
Good.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
I'm afraid you are.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Lowell?
Uh, what are those boxes?
What do you need at the store?
I'm doing an interview.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
I'm alone on this...
...you fucked me!
Oh, my God.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What do you mean?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Oh, please, Mike...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Did work.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
...okay.
Next to your father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I heard.
No? No, what?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, what do you really think, though?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
It acts as a...
Hello.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Baby. You are so HOT!
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
No!
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Triple!
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
It was a gift from a client.
We did not.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
So who'd you hire?
You're vulnerable.
These are yours.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
What is it you're after, Miles?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Thank you.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Honey, I could sit...
Miles.
Marylin!
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Sweet.
Marylin.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Who's that?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Is this Ming?
Mr. Massey --
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
And it's good!
Ah.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Nothing.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
What...?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Who's "Patty."
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Yeah.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
I'm sorry you read it.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Yes, sir.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What happened to your money?
Driver!
Yeah?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean—
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
High time you got back.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
You always want to run everything.
To New York?
Yeah.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Not a one.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
was—but—
But what!
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Amazing.
What're you going to do?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
I hope you got your money.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
Huh?
What's the idea?
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Street cats?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And Shaw?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
There were admirals.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I want the truth.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  Never heard of him.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
You know who the mayor was?
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Never touched me.
How much more?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Not a problem.
You were there for me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
I found out.
Great, you're here.
She sound scared?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
But now you're telling us now you do.
Fine.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Shit.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
He's got that kinda money?
What'dya think?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
Who is this?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
My ass ain't the same.
You talk them into it?
I called you last night.
You think he's got a thing for you?
You know some interesting people.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Set him up.
I hesitated taking that much.
I know.
Where're you going?
Yes'm.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
You talk to him?
What did you say?
She didn't say.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
Do you think I took some of that money?
He said he didn't know about it.
Kinda.
Thanks.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Beaumont Livingston.
What the hell you doin'?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
The Cockatoo Inn.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
How long?
Is it ready to go?
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
Sure.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Where you shot her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
He's a big one. You two tight?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Haven't a clue.
I got some more business for ya.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
In a way, yes.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
You expect me to just walk in there?
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I know where it is.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He leave town?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Are you all right?
Grass never did that to me.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
That's right. We did.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
There was a bang.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Why do you say that?
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
Jacob, what can I do?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Jake, is that you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
That help?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I must have been out of my head.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Ready?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Where are we?
Can't you stop it?
How high is that?
That's your decision.
What? What do you mean?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You can have anything you want.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Push 'em back.
I'll page him.
Lennox Hospital.
That black car?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
I have some ice from the machine.
Is he all right?
On top of him?
What's that?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Where have you been?!!
Hey! I'm not ready.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
We'd need charges.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Jesus what the hell is that?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
We're screwed!
What's this?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
She needs a little time.
And what's with the headgear?
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
I'm just saying.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Ow!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Something's wrong.
Then open the doors!
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
The wire's showing!
I never saw one that big.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Have you ever had one do this?
He's trying to sink us!
He's comin' up -- !
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
No, we just checked the beach...
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
What happened?
This has got to be one big violation...
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We're not even sure what it was.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Transplants?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Anti-Shark cage.
I'm okay...
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You know how I feel about her.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
You're being really immature.
Why?
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
No... I guess not.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Commercials.
I wrote that.
I know what junk is.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Hm.
She answered our prayers.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
I'm cool.
No it is not!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Shush, Adele.
What the hell is this stuff?
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's your name, boy?
Vernon, Florida.
So what do you do Early?
Can't hurt.
Now why is that?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...and?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
Thanks. What are you doing?
What's that?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
...never?
What is it?
Who are you?
...That'd be my guess.
With how many people?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
Right.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Why I do what?
You are?
Casper.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Sup. Sup.
Yeah. Come on.
What do I want to do?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Dance!
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I guess so.
Thanks.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Whah?
Yep.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
What man? What is it?
Casual.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
You know her?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
What word did you leave last night?
Yes?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You don't understand.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Now what?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Congratulations, dad.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Same as the others?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
I'm busy right now.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Kathy?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
We're going to work on the message.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Through a rental agency.
That's it?
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
You sound like my mother.
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know it was bad.
Doesn't that scare you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Fine.
Hi.
It's not that easy.
You're right.  The killer told me.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I will find you. I will be with you.
Lyssa ...
They have Lyssa!
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You have not slept in two days.
I cannot reach her.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Can she be forced?
From here, I must go alone.
I cannot betray my bride.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
I have need of friends.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
How did you know I had sons?
Well, I'm not impressed.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
Quell?
Sugarballs?
Put me down, you lout!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is important to assure the succession.
I knew.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
Each to his fate, lad.
We had no children.
It is no trickery.
You see?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
OK, I'm fine.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Rocket launcher.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Come on, get down!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
I love you so much, Leon.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
You say it just to calm me!
...I got lost, Mister.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
You can't sit here like that.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
He probably just went somewhere.
Here comes the resume.
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I know what you're getting at.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Yes?
The new store?
Walk with me?
You can change.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
I'm walking there Kris.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
I need your help.
... My father.
I don't have kids.
What do you mean?
What's your shoe size?
It's yours.
Coffee?
No.
Water?
Hello!
Are you working?
I guess I do too.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
OK.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
Where have you been staying?
Why would I kill my husband?
I loved him!
I'll take that as a no.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
What's going on?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
I'm sorry, but --
Yes?
Yes?
I think so...
Our group is full.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
What?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
You have Stromwell.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
But maybe it's not what you think.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
What're you doing here?!
Class schedule, map, book list.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
No.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You go where?
I didn't mean --
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Why so few?
Fool's magic.
You... you're a beast!
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
By the grace of God.
Track the demon to his lair.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
What know you of fields of war?
Wait, Jack.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Will you chance a miss?
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
I don't... understand.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
I may have said perhaps...
Oh, dear.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I thought you were dead... I --
What?
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Pinching?  Where?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
How do I get the horn back?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Is she fair, this princess?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Lost?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
He hasn't called?
Mom?
Don't you have school?
You're a good girl.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
We're not gonna do anything.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I thought I was helping you.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
And if I enclosed it?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I'm good, thanks.
how much weight have you lost?
Right...she married...what was he?
Maybe...?
For everything.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Thank you.
Is Alyssa here?
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
This has got to stop!
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I did warn you.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Did you got through my pants?
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know parts of who you are.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I would have killed him.
You look better than ever.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
What would you do?
Good for you.
Ah!  Oh....
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Oh.  Sorry.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
What did you do with your dog?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
Which?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
With your hands or your tongue?
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
It's been a while.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I was talking about our marriage.
What are you doing home?
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Nagger?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
I'm talking about a haircut.
These are free papers.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Married?
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Don't I know you?
You went to Monroe?
Where they taking us, anyway?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
A loan officer?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Like this?
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
He's dead.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
No, man. I want you to have it.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
What do you want, Claude?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Crop duster.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I said you're soft.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
'Course I was right. About what?
You ever done time before?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What do you think about that?
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
I can't take that, mama.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
No!
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Release the evil?
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
This is baloney!
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Knock, knock.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
No. This can't be happening.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
I know, your wickedness.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
It's Stanley, sir.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Hey...
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Should we wake him up?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Adrian?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
The South.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Hey.
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
..."The Devil?"...
We're going to Jersey?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
All right -- what are you?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Had enough?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
I'm Mary 2.
I'm very smart.
No.  Just no.
You prefer women?
Why tell me?
I wish I could help you.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What kind of jewel is this?
No.
What people?
Come with us.
Gracious... no.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Where are they?
I'm sorry.
Can you make it back?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
What is?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Hello.
Are you positive he knows?
Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
When he went to work, right.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
I like to laugh, Fred.
What's that?
You're up early.
So?
Let's go home.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
How ya doin', Pete?
Yeah.
You still care about me?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Fossils.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Well, that's that, I guess.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Chalmers Bryant!
Gold. You were going to—
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
And mine's Conway.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Oh, good heavens, no!
They were.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, immediately.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
How can we get in touch with them?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Are you taking me?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Yes.
Well - I mean—
You can't leave, George.
So you think I'm mad?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Yes, everything!
Where were you hiding?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
Cowan--
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
It'll make sense later?
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
Right.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
What's going on, Kay?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
How does that help me?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
in case I need it?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What is it?
When?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
I dunno. One?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Which way?
I'm getting a trajectory...
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
He's here.
Please --
Oh, God...
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She grew up.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
I put you away --
You made those tapes...
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Kill type?
Victim's a white female.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Yeah?  So?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Confirm with trig and image.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I need your help.
Are you reading my mind right now?
What the hell.
I forgive you.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
You're not gonna kill me?
Something wrong?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Not if I stay away from him.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Tell him not now.
None of your damn business.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Lamar, I found something.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Who?
Howard --
I like it.
What does he want with a precog?
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What are you talking about?
Yes, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
We used to take baths together.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Get your hands off of her.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
What's your record at?
What's up? Jess ready?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Yeah?
This is it.
Pshhh...
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I'll work it off.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yeah. Sure.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
It's important.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Can you check?
So?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
How am I being shitty?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Fuck him.
I like it.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
It's ours.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What exactly did they say?
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
He woulda told us right?
Where do you think you're going?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Where?
What are you doing.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
What do you have left?
Calm down.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
You want your surprise?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Drinks are free, right?
Where's Spa.
'Strapped?'
Ow, shit...
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Good morning.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
We're square.
Thanks.
That money is your per diem.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Yes, sir.
No. I'll take a strega.
She poured it for --
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
I'll get it.
How's it feel?
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Don't con me. Don't try...
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What the hell for, man?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I will do it.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Make it plain.
What points?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
You have enough worries of your own.
Yes.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Is my family here yet?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Sure, man.
What?
I say a lot of things.
'Bout every other night, Red.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Let's go.
Your control over your children, therefore --
How many you turning out?
No. You'll be marked for death.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm the man.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Are you sure?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
So you are going to talk me to death.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Who's he?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
What do you mean, I'm here?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Yeah, right...
You been working?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
I'm a bargain.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
It hurts.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Where's my mother?
You don't drink like you used to.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Sorry.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's fantastic.
He has to go, Samuel.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
All right, I'll see you!
Who you gonna call?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
When was this?
Your son Marty?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Yeah.
I'm having a very good time, too.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Yes, I know.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
I'd like that very much.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Sure, what?
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Ma.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
You gonna die without a son.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hello, Ralph.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy...
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
What?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
We could steal one of the choppers.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Is that liquor?
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
No, no, that one.
For you, Trapper.
It's in pretty deep.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
What do we do?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
All of them?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
See you.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
He's coming to.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Action?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
What letter?
In what man!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Hurry up, Pop.
Okay, fellows.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
No.
Both of 'em?
Hey, Boss.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Ba-ll!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Sure, you are.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
What's your name?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Yeah.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Hello, guys.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You want me to go up with you?
What's the line?
What happened? Is there a problem?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
What happened, Mike.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Don't make do it, Mike.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Roper...
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Do you really?
I think I can handle that one.
Tell me what you need.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
Yes.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
We lost.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Only that floor.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
That a new picture?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Yeah?
A deeper level?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Depends. What's up?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
And a car.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Okay...
This is how you pick up women --
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
You sure he's going to come?
What?
The woman you're stuck on.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Why?
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
Try harder.
Cleaning up a mess.
You said we were on the same programming team.
It was a test.
What's so funny?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Connect to public access.
He's on us!!
Release the power with the power.
Anybody see anything?
I'm in!
Hey, boss!
Anybody see them?
We're asking you to go to prison.
Boo-Boo.
Life knocked me back.
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I was calling yesterday.
I needed to see you again.
I booked passage to London.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Forget it. That's past.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Shuddup.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Monkeybone?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Olive or eyeball?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Uh huh. And?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
You're acting kind of...odd.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Who?
I don't think so.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
Who told you we deal drugs?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
It couldn't be.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
What! Who?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
What do I play?
Paine.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Is the wind tired out there?
No--not offhand--
Susan? Nah!
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Sam Foley--dead!
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
For one week!
Thank you, sir.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Y-yes.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Just fine.
What is it?
Most natural thing in the world!
Go ahead--punch.
Punch?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Committee.
Why?
Some committee's got it.
Try sitting down.
I did--and--and I got right up.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Terrible, thank you.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
In Terry Canyon?
Great.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Don't mention it--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Then you *did* say it.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
"So help me God."
You were about to recognize me, sir--
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Ax?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
I know that.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Yeah?  And what else?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
That's him. Let him in.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Yes.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
No, no children.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Yes, but I—
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What happened?
Tell me more about yourself.
I enjoy it.
Sure. I met you.
What are they going to do?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There's Times Square.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Here's a nice place.
I've often thought about going back.
You have?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
No. It's nothing.
Huh?
Look, I can do it!
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
What're you going to do?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Oh, yes sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Must we have the echo?
Hang up.
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Where?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Nah.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Yes?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Uh-huh.
What is your name?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
One hundred books?
Dr. Mumford.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
What are you doing for lunch?
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
A little.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
My patient had to leave early.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
And the Brocketts?
...And?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Okay.
But you know how to drive?
I'm trying.
Is she a friend of yours?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Oh... not a real doctor.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Finally, some common sense...
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
No.
Sorry... I'm done.
Where?
It's all right.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm glad.
...How violated I feel?
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Nah... scotch.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
What?
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Hey, Skip.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Slash what?
It's not?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
Sounds like you have several.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
That'd be Lily.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
No... no training.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
You know where he's taking her?
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Immune from what?
What does he want the book for?
What just happened?
Yeah?
Intestines.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
The sun turning black.
And what is he in prison for?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
Can you swim?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
Not unless you call me Rick.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got guts, lady.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
That just makes you more gullible.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Juicy?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
I know you knew I'd know.
Really?
It must have slipped my mind.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
He'll never make it.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Have you considered my offer?
I got it.
Superheroes.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Come here.
Then why are you here?
Who?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I'm going inside.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
But there's still only six of us.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
The who?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Wow.
You did?
Definitely.
This is bad.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Oh no.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I'm glad you like it.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
And where is Joseph?
Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sir.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
A glass of champagne, please.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
What is that?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Good evening, sir.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Only Lisette?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
I know of no better time.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Were you in love with him?
Were they pretty?
Promises mean nothing.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Fuck, what's his name?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
$247.
Blow.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
No.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
I don't know.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I don't play for no team.
What is it?
I do.
You coming in?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Today ain't my day.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
You wanna knock?
What?!  What that mean?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Where's Craig?
Get on.
William.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
What about that ugly dog?
Mr. Nasty time?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
You shot her?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Good luck.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Come with us, sir.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Are you 'fucking with me!?
Tell me why I miss him.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Let me talk to her again.
Is that something precious?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Ready?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
All right.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Fuckin' A.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I've done much better ones than this.
What gives?
What do you figure he done with it?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
Here they come.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
And the Lord told that man --
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Twenty-five wives!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
She's gone to Moundsville.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Huh?
Mm-hm.
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
I was praying.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Them kids!
What you been up to?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Now who was this?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
What happens if they don't do that?
My dream.
How you plan to do that?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
How you know that?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Feeling better?
I never touched her.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
From Leon.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You should be more careful, Anna.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
You didn't get legal advice?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
A blue shirt, perhaps?
I am, Gaston.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
...and Kopalski.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
No visa.
Why should I take a chance?
Thank you.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
I will start with you.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Thank you.
I must go.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then how did you get here?
At what?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Not funny, huh?
Yes.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Are we going to build our little house?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Those newspaper people?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana.
No thanks, Swana.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Has done what?
Now, please, Swana.
Good morning.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I must ask you to leave.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Unfortunately.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Your Highness.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
We'll see about that ...
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
I'll bet he would.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
McCord? ...
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
That's right ...
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Well, why not?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Where are they?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
We really must go, Mr. President.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
The White House.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
How about Kissinger along with him?
The lie?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Elvis I like, too.
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
It makes us human ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Anything.
He looked old, didn't he?
Because ... I have to relax.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
Congratulations, Dick.
Yes.
Thank you.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
To what?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
How'd you know I was here.
How many a those things you got now?
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Yes.
Oh yes.
Hard to believe.
Nothin'?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Some pretty bad people.
He won't neither. He never has.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yes sir.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
...This month's checks.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Well I didn't see it.
You gave your word?
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
It's full a money.
No. I found it.
Just keep it up.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Yeah.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
What should I do?
She'll be all right.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Hello?
...You getting anything on this?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Yes.
This. And the gas.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
...What time do you go to bed.
Yes I do.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Uh-huh.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
The kind with the most poles.
One room, one night.
I want you to take me to another motel.
When did you last see him.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
What do you want to know?
...I'm wondering...
What about one forty-two.
No, one forty-two.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Not that way.
Not any way.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Pot metal?
You do, I reckon.
Are you in the service?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
That's a nice name for what you need...
"Banners?"
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
That's my son! My son is dead!
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Maroon.  I stole it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Do what?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Why do they keep calling you George?
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
I have... did it sound that bad?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
I begged him to let me put that on!
I'll go to the Hospital.
You made out alright.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
How many men have I talked to?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Looking for someone?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
We should go.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
Who's this?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Hmm?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No... before that.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Izzat right?
Okay, Everett.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
That's not my ring.
You -
The preacher said it absolved us.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Yes, Sir.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Come back here, kid!
Great ass.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Mayo, are those your friends?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
No, sir!
Yes, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
What?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Seriously.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Do you go to school?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
You stayed after all.
I don't want you to move.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Are those for me?
Why?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
You okay?
Hey, you guys still awake?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
He said open it.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Th --
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
They're not supposed to be here!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No fucking way.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Too many stairs.
Well, I know that now.
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Uh uh.
Why?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Get out of the car.
Yeah, it's me.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
You were. infantry right?
I'm down.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
I saw... but...
Just a kid.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Nothing.
Sorry man...
What?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
You couldn't have known.
Excuse me?
Yes, sir.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
And the Governor?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
What now, sir?
Did your father teach you humility?
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
One of yours?
I'm sorry.
Who's in command?
Don't touch him.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
For what?
That bad?
Father... I killed those men...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Well...I guess not.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Does she love the cat?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
You keep saying that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
What did we do, Jud?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Gage's gone!
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I just said--
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
I'll drop it!
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
That would hardly be proper.
What?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Say again?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
How did you get off the island?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
You would do that?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Why are brothering with that?
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
What's that?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
... No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
He's still breathing.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Wheelchair accessible.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Yeah?  So what?
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
You were never invited to my house.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
What's it smell like?
The big house.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Just like old times.
Do you have something to bring me down?
That's pretty good.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Where is it?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
What in the...?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, what a fight that was.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
And you have him?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother!
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
It has been alleged - yes—
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Oh no, sir!
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
My error.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
I dyed one and washed the other.
It'll be ready in a minute.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Me, sir?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Well, sir, I putter.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hi ...
What?
You can't go out there.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
It's six-thirty ...
I'm busy.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Want some bridge mix?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
What happened?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Well, I never had to do it before.
What?
Green.
What are you doing?
Just take deep breaths.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
What were you doing in a library?
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Yes.
I told you. I'm like positive.
No. I baked them for you.
Hi.
Oh ... Hi.
What's that like?
You want some berries?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Don't get upset.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
What?
Excuse me?
... Yeah.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Yeah ...
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Yes, I'll be there.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
...please, I just don't want it....
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
I have work, I can't leave.
It's fine, but --
Goodbye.
Hey. What are you doing?
You're so scared.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Really?
No.
Where is she?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I know but I....how much is it?
No. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected before....
-- you said you did.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I don't know.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
What do you do with all this pudding?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
What do you mean?
...I don't know what you mean....
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I forgot about that.
Ok.
-- and this is confidential?
No one will know your name.
How many sisters do you have?
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Where you goin?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Where you been?
Hey.
I need to talk to you for a second.
You have an ATM?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
You can't be late.
Seriously.
What's the problem?
Hello?
What did you say?
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
We should be going --
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
He did seem a little strange.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
I must grant him his last rites.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Good day, Marquis.
His rug.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Was it impotence?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Don't start --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
...yes, I've got that bit...
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
And I in yours.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Not you too
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Randolph!
You know that can't happen.
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
How bad is it?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
You needn't use that language with me
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
How so?
He lied to me
Showing life
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Yes.
Please don't say this.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Don't do this
Fuck you--
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
It's just that my movie is so-
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
No, we're jake. But listen-
It was fun, wasn't it?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Jack! Enough!
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
You wasn't with her, were you?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Say what you're gonna say.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
What did Tommy say?
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
How's that?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
What time is it?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Jake, no --
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
It don't look right.
Oh. When are they expected home?
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
She never left the apartment --
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Jeff -- huh?
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
Did you ever own a saw?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Like an old hambone?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
This is Wednesday.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I don't want to.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
Police?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Who's Thorwald?
Anything else bothering you?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
How can you tell that -- from here?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
That's a suitcase?
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Shut up. I'm all right.
A new disease.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Hi.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You thought I was Mom?
Yes.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I don't think so--
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
He's just loaded, honey.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
He's home.  I heard the car.
See?  It stopped.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Where did you get the gun?
What?
I'm here.
Are you really going to meet them?
How'd you get here?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Isn't he schizoid?
Who?
I've got a gun.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No.  At dawn.
What's that got to do with it?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
No.
Leave me alone.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
"Life is crushing in on me."
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You smell like baby powder.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
After he tried to shoot you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Yes.  My best friend.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Gabriel, let him go --
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
To all those cons...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Radio said negative five.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
He'll kill you.
You told him about Nick's letters.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
What?
Nick, what happened --
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
What?
You... you... YOU --
Be more specific.
Five million?
I did.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
At least gimme video poker.
Ash?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Merlin, I didn't know --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Ain't there yet.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Jesus, Rudy --
Tell Ashley... I...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
And you set me up.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my king!
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Where was she from, Compton?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
What about?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
But what is this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
It's a change.
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Like hell I am.
That's your proof?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
I know.
So, talk.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
For what, the cops?
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Dead.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's wrong with it?
What do you think?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
What's the matter with her?
But you eat, don't you?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
So that was why she tried to run away.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Will she be dark or fair?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Maybe it's better that way.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I -- lost something.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Kind of sore.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I can't take her with me.
What is it?
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Suppose I take a look.
They shouldn't have done that.
And we're running out of that.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
We might as well start a fire.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Where is he?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Gee, I can't.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
But you're his brother.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
My favorite memory was when we --
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
It's coming!
Shhh... It's okay.
No, stay.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Great!!!
Listen to me I --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Where's Shorty?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Uh, uh.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Are you?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
Let me see the files.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Hello Dwight.
Thanks, handyman.
You never could feel your legs.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
What?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Oh Mom...
CHIP!!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Don't wake the kids...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
You forgot something...
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
You can?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
When I wanted to.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Yes.
Why, Mary --
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Who the devil is he?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I don't know.
What's that?
She'll have to know some time.
Good-bye.
What's wrong, Mary?
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Tell me what?
Dr. Judd?
You know where she is?
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
I'm very, very serious.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Have you ever been on television?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
...free-lance. You know.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Mother, father, sister.
You're what?
Does it bother you?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
Yes.
Yes.
To you?
I'm sorry this came up.
Yes.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
I have money.
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Is he going to see this?
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Yes.
Her name was Elizabeth.
Subtlety?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
I'm not either!!
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
What?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
What do you mean?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What do you mean?
God, no.
No, I haven't.
No, he left last week.
Why?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Because I never got around to it.
No!
Then why'd you call me?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Yes, I did.
He wouldn't do that.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
About what?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
No.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Is that what he tells you?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
I'm intrigued.
Do you want me to stop calling?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Hung up.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Hi. Want a drink?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Medical clinic?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
You say something?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Yes?
That you, Rog?
Yes?
No? How come?
You bet, Bert.
A wreck.
You got it!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
When do I get to see Brad?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Dentonvale has been sold.
In a way...
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
McKinley?...McKinley?
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
That's us.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Oh my poor baby.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
You're practically naked!
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
Farley!
F for...
Our speciality.
And none of them worked?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Miles.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Oh yeah.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
What?
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Let me call Christine.
How would you rate this one?
Are you chewing gum?
We should have driven.
Whoa.
If that's what feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
She is very hot.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
What do you think?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
We were supposed to play golf.
I will.  See ya!
What the fuck are you doing?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Nice shot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
What's it look like to you?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
You said it looked like a car accident.
You broke some.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Love you, man.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I'm having the salmon.
Is she sleeping or...?
Oh. You mean... today?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Bathroom over there?
Okay.
Maya.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
That's great.
I'm pregnant.
How much skin and stem contact?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
Should we get dessert?
You golf?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes funny.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
My ballet recital.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
Do you think it's a possibility?
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're broadcasting...
How do they know it's over?
That's good enough for me.
Morgan?
Dad.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
I can't even imagine.
The footprints.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Sounds like a virus.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
All I did was kiss a girl.
What friend is that?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
McKendrick's men got him.
Kate?
They've been kind to me.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
They got a saloon there?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Howdy.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Hello, Rae.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
It's the only place I'm happy.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What is it that I can't figure?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I've got a place I can hide her.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Spare me.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
She doesn't want pity.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Of course.
Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Who are you really?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
You want me to call Security?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
What's that?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
It's a yacht.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Mr. Sayer...
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
I forgot your name.
No.
You mean aneurysm.
You said the "s" word.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
What'd you write?
Words.
Something I want?
...No.
What?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Yes?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
When?
No.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
And you know what else?
You know that accident up there?
They want me to do things for them.
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
...He doesn't get invited places.
It's our pleasure.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Bitch.
Someone actually... employs you?
Aha. The Lovers.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Sounds familiar.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Should we be doing this, dude?
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You'll be back.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
About what?
It's you. You and your father.
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like what?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
-- Where have you two been?
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
Oh, yeah?
How about Brenda?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
You took Bill.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
I never danced in a towel before.
Who's that?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
What's he get if he wins here?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
An existentialist.
They're both a challenge.
I give up.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
By stealing my car?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
Yeah?
Why should I?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Why are we doing this?
Hit the brakes!
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
That's correct.
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Did he give you his name?
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
That's probably him now...
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Here. Sit.   Please.
What are you doing here?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No shit.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
I DON'T KNOW!
What's the time frame?
I can trust Rheya.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
He'll let me in.
That depends.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Will she come back?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
Don't.
Why?
You go home.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What happened?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Sartorius.
Was she right?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
You don't want me.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Do you?
You should have told me.
Chris --
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I can't --
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Are you nervous?
I'll come with you.
You were reading my Renoir.
They're kind of fuzzy.
They called here after you left...
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
What a memory.
They guys treatin' you all right?
"For"...?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Not if you don't want me to.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
What shit, honey?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Did you hear what I said?
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
I'm sorry.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
At my house...!
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
And Flash isn't?
Oh, sure.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Lizzy!
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Mr. Jameson--
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Even if they're not clever.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Well, no.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Waldos.
Toxic dumps, huh.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Yes.  Do you have a date?
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
How much do you know about it?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
What's the match gag?
In this barracks?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Sefton!
Yeah.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
You're crying, Animal.
You want to go?
Yes, sir.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
We've all done a poor job of it.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You taking Dunbar?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
You heard him.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Really? What do you feel?
What?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
These are my children...my children.
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
I don't understand.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Well, may we have a look around?
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The Nexus.
Aye, sir.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
... Fascinating.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
I'll handle that later.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
This planet is aging in surges.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
The ship... Out of danger...?
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
See! That shimmering area.
About a dozen officers and men.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!

I -- saw no future --
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What you ask is difficult.
How can you tell that?
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
500 Kellicams!
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Khan could be down there!
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
What?
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
What are you looking at?
Don't you believe it.
Departing dark side, Regula.
Time's up, Admiral...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
I would not presume to debate you.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
The power of creation --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
... the good of the few...
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
On screen...
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Stop engines.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Shields activated!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
Where must you go?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
That's crazy!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Like what?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Where could you take them?
What do you mean now?
You want the details?
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
But Kirk...
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
Oh my God, we're too late!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Permission to come aboard.
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
How do you know this...?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Spock...
Why not?
I see.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Ready sir.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
You have warp capability?
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
You're what?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Really.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
A ship,
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
How many?
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Worf to Picard...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
No, sir...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
What are they interested in...?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Do you know what this is, Data?
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Vulcan?
I believe so.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Where?
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Ready.
Yes.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
That's impossible.
Why?
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Port battery, ready sir!
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Just a little queasy...
Someone...?
Even Data?
Spock, that was actually funny.
Can you - ?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Damned clever if you ask me...
We're explorers not diplomats!
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
That isn't true...!
Spoken by you?
You were demoted...
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Your friends are late...
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Sir?
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
What exactly does that mean?
Why?
No. Can I move now?
Is he very much like you were?
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
Yes, sir.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Deanna, on my mark.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
No!
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
You don't trust me.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I don't know.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
But surely...
You don't have to understand.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Eh... yes.
Where did you stop last?
Recognize this?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
What?
What?
What?
Minneapolis... good.
Closed?
No gas.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What?
I want to try it.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
No.
No.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
But I must go here.
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Can I have the gun?
Yes.
Yes.
I like this music.
I feel better if I move.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
What?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I know how to gamble now.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
The yellow one.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
In the cars, too?!
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Was there visual contact?
I don't understand.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Forget it's there.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Talk to me about costs, here.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Top ten.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's been cooked-off
Where's Faith?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Nero.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Sleaze to peddle.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Are we having a bad night?
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
Is this great fabric or what?
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
This is bad.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
You see Tran?
Take it to him.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Besides that.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
No.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
You're a... you're sick.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I'm hesitant to...
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
None taken.
This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Jesus.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You were right. He found me.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Tom, you okay?
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
What happened?
Unlock these cuffs.
Who are you?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Zero killed them all?
You knew it was me all along?
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Was it Zero?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Reality very risky.]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Thomas Mackelway.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You're right. I know.
Don't do it, Mike.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Just like that?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
No.
A couple of high rollers like you?
What do you guys do?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Me too.
Yeah. And an actor.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...It's really getting late.
Yeah, hold on.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
Oh no?
An eight.
Bud.
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
You miss the pain?
She was cute.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Wait.
Vegas.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
It doesn't matter...
Always.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
No! Not the camera guy!
That was different.
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah. You met him once.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
How you guys doing?
What a surprise.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What the fuck..?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
It's on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
The bear's got his claws back.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Be my friend.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
You take care of Paulie?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
Are you worried about security for your million?
What is this nonsense?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
How?
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
They're waiting to see my father.
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
You really want to know?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Will you?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
How can you be sure?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You're unlucky.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Good afternoon!
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Freddie?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
Why?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Really? To Italy?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Frederico!
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Hardly.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Such as?
Okay.
I never said that!
That ring's so great. The green one.
What about Cortina?
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Emily.  Just kidding.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
You know what -- I am.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
That's good, isn't it?
No.
What did he say?
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Why lie?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Even her.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Huh?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
What did you do?
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
You forgot "sexy".
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Is he Italian?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's fine.
Could you see anything?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
One-Ball McCall?
I don't like my real name.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
I musta been stoned.
Do you understand why I came here?
Pittsburgh.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He shoots dope too.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
What should I do? Call the cops?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
You want to work uptown nights?
No, I want long shifts.
Who?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's going on?
What's the action around?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
He says he's leaving the island sir.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Motor oil?
Surprise, surprise.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
I wish you were coming with me.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
How'd it go?
Well...
You look... different.
And why not?
Nine hundred...
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Your dancing's very good.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes it does.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Mother o'god...
Good to meet you.  Again.
A super market.  Huh.
We've been closed for a while.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Here, one of mine.
Aren't you coming?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Luke didn't smoke.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
When was that?
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Please, sit.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Miss Hayworth?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
It's a lovely garden.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
No!
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Of course.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Thank you.
Lovebirds, I see.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
I'm simply quoting the law.
She was selling birds.
I know, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Yes.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Not by the thousands.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
So you're a lawyer.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
What?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
What did it say?
Why?
I have several jobs.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I think it's safe to get out now.
The bay doesn't.
Have we still got power?
Almost two a.m.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
We need them.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I'm cold as ice.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
But Richardson?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
I remember her.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
No.
What?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
It might be an interesting case.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
But why, Gray? Why?
Can anyone hear what we say?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Any attacks of pain since?
How long ago?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Was that it? Well, ok.
The strip joint?
Keep that thing away from me.
How do you know?
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
I don't believe you.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Hi Mom!
Professor Barnhardt.
Yes, I have!
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I don't believe it.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Hello--
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
How do you know?
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Where is the meeting going to be?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I was.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
But how -- how long--?
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
How long will that take?
I don't like horror comics.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Look.
I will, David!
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
In here?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
What do you mean?
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Take laddie.
It's gone.  I feel it!
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Piss off.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Sixteen.
What do you want from us?
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Watch Clark.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Was dark... find a light...
The dogs?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
We should have jumped his ass.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Put that down!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Looks good.
Four!
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
The generator!
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
I had an accident.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Send him away.
What?
Machines?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
What do you mean?
Vox --
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I won't leave you like this.
I'll never forget this.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Why would you let me go back?
Now will you go?
And why not?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You promised me flowers.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Let's walk through the park...
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
What is it?
I can't do that --
Good night, David.
His curiosity is amazing.
Your husband is dead?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Why?
We all have that dream.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
So you can use it now?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
May I get you some --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
He said he traveled for two months.
Why?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We choose to believe it.
We'll see about that.
No, you're safe --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Then don't.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
We are not birds of a feather.
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
But I like it I guess.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Why?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
No, he didn't.
I don't understand.
My God you look exactly like him.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
What do you mean?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why not?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Sure.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
I'm sorry.
Have a good day at work today.
Darryl.
Honey?
What?
In the leg.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
What kind of gun was it?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Tell me.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
It's nothin' like that.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Give me the keys.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
So what are you gonna tell him?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Now what what?
Before.
What?!  What about him?!
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
You do?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What?
Yes, Thelma?
What do you mean?
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
We've gone insane.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
You're a good friend.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Gay? He said you were gay?
Good-looking?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Never met him.
No You mean...?
Uh-huh.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Here, just have one of these then.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Nepal? Have you been?
Don't you want to know my name?
Some buildings I'm working on.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Are you okay?
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Well, I know you're busy...
No.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Three different guys?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
You bet.
Kim and I are close friends!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Pat's an architect, too.
What's up, Doc?
What's up?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
What's that?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Please leave.
Go!
What what are you doing here?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
How are you doing, Warren?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Starshells.
Yes, sir.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Secretary of Defense...
Hey, sport. You winning?
I was eating that.
I don't care. Cancel it.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
What are you doing?
What journey?
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
She's that subtle?
Why?
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
What are you --
His spiritual mother...
He knows me?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Ray --
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Sorry.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
X22. Read.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
What ya want?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
That's all!
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Where were you?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What if he's not?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
It dies. We live.
Anything.
Danger?
. Yeah!
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
Now?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Tomcats?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
That's missile lock!
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Yawing right.
No! Not again!
Is there something I should know?
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
That's not what I heard.
How was it?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Come on, we're next.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
1000.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
What the hell you doing?
You didn't help.
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
I lost.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
How do you feel?
I called your house.
I know.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
I'm nothing like him.
What's wrong with this one?
First time on Mars?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Who are you?
Would you like the same suite?
I'll go encode your room key.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
No, sir.
But I thought...
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Sleazy...and demure.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
On his way.
What, aliens?
You're Kuato, right?
No shit...
What trip?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Shit!
I've got a weak signal over there.
I've got a lock!  There!
How did I get in this taxi?!
...You mean it?
And you believe him?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
It was implanted by the Agency.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Mars.
What's in the two week package?
No options.
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
I think you better leave.
I said get out!
Not bad, for a hooker.
I don't need Kuato for that.
The reactor.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
You're full of shit.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Its tires are flat...
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Use the fucking bomb!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
What?
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
You okay?
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
I brought it... to the coroner.
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
It most certainly is.
Don't hurt him.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Objection.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
You can't remember that -- !
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
So what're we gonna do?
But what?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I'm not that desperate.
Let's get a cab.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
What's Art Esparza?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Figures.
Exactly what happened then?
-- About what?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Y-yes, sir.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
You getting this?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
No... No, go away.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes...
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
And no one found the ring?
Where's Hap?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
You're not mad at me?
What can I tell you?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
You got it.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
James...
This afternoon?
What do you mean?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
When he finds out.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Boating?
Eating?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Can I take the car?
Dad.
We're late to get to your mother.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Leland...
As if I didn't know.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
...he wants to testify...?
You would not...?
I do. Yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
What is this going to cost?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Why is that?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Right. Who called?
Yes.
...that's perfectly all right.
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
Thank you for seeing me.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Are you done?
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
And it's over...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
What are you going to do?
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Miss Costello...?
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I didn't do it, Mister.
It's locked.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
I'm going to help her.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
...he's a good man...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Been a long time, huh...?
How are you holding up?
Are you with me... are you awake...?
The Doctors.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
So is the town, I notice!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
They don't do much of anything...!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
What's up?
Chase, you'd better come home.
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Yes.
No.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
DO you mind...
Dylan, where's the man?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Studio B.
What's that?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Come in.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
How old are you, son?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
Believe what?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Can we talk?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do what?
No way!
Where are you from any way?
Who?
I don't know.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
And being sixteen.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Don't ever call me stupid.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
I understand.
This be it?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
Gas?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
That is my permiso.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Hasta siempre.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
What?
That bastard Pucinski...
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
What's that honey?
That don't seem fair.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
What'd you say to her?
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
It's just another case, Sailor.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
Where?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Yeah.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
You upset with me?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
You find any work?
Anything I can do for you?
Love you, too.
So where'd you say you was?
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
I'll bet.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
What if I told you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Yes.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Life is unpredictable.
I didn't see nothin'...
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Boy or girl?
Hello?
You're in Kinship?
...reconcile with Emily.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
You cold, James?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Really?
You?
Miss Sloviak's.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
That's a big book you're writing.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Outside Scranton.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
It's warm.
Want a bite?
When?
Near Carvel?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Jesus.
That good, huh?
I got the message you called.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Yes.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Is the thing -- is it over?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
You heard? How?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Are you sure you parked it there?
And what do you think you might have said?
He told me.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
No.
Who's that guy?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
No, the dog.
Are you riding with me, James?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I doubt it, darling.
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Sure.
There's a million birds here.
How does it sound?
Okay?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
The passionate one?
But you are taking it?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
I'm twelve.
No thank you.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Your daddy will always love you.
I know because... it's just something I know.
I don't mind.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
They usually tell me.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
When did it all start?
That's not a helpful answer.
Where are you?
What the hell are you doing there?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
What picture?
Southern light.
K through sixth.
No you're not.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You're not joking.
I never hurt them. Never.
What?
Depraved? My mistake.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I know.
I love my brothers.
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
What about O-2?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
God, I hate that bitch.
That's Perry.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
I'm thirsty.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Used to what?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And why haven't they left each other?
Yes, you should go.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
I don't love you.
But for what reason should I come there?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Ettore...
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Anything new develop?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
No.
Because...
Why?
But she watches... she listens.
Why?
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Why?
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know... I don't know...
That wasn't me.
No I'm not.
Right now?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
I went to my room.
Where'd it come from before that?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
I can't have them any more.
No questions.
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Because I don't want one.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Is that what she said?
What did you do?
That you're a mistake?
Alright.
Who am I?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
And then what happened?
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
???
Larry...
All I want is one more week.
Who told you this?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
... Thank you.
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Who?
That possibility never occurred to you?
And you weren't shocked?
I'm only interested...
What?
Aquittal.
How?
All right, what do you need.
Do you know what she did to her?
Because I didn't know... 
We'll see about that.
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
You think she's a saint?
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
I'm concerned about her health.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Of course, John.
The usual ten per cent?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Y'what?
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Why aren't you at work?
Can you fix him for me?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Me? Why?
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
But I won't.
I beg your pardon?
What's up?
Is he?
I don't think that bit's right.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
Sorry.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
How'd you guess?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
They ought to be.
What are you?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
You can learn from books.
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Anything to spare?
No, that's his other one.
Like what?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
I'll brook no denial!
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
My eyes are lighter.
Is it?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
Well!
And?
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
That's mine.
What?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Are you in pain?
Do you remember the pyramid?
Gravity?
Close enough to walk to!
Can we come up?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Boy, that's terrific.
Yes?
He's running a fever.
Yes.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
The flamethrower!
Can you get them back?
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
This should do it.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
What is it?
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
And what do we do when we find it?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Let's hear it.
Anything else?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
I understand why you did that.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Seal everything now!
Where is she?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Oh, man...
How much air-time have I got?
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Wait.  Lost it.
What happened?
Okay.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Compensate!
Okay, we're in business.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Four.
That's the wrong way!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Eddie...
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
I never intended you to be.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
What do you mean by that?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Why not?
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Feeling better, my dear?
I was there. An eyewitness.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Right here. A minute ago.
Nothing?
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
Huh?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Paranoiac!
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Groom.
I just wondered.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
Don't be dense. The party.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
What report? To whom?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
If I only knew how...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
The show must go on.
Of course.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
I'll never get over it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
I'd like to hear it.
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
Three or four miles...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Margo, again...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve.
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
She was a revelation...
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
But that was the fourth straight time.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Miss Caswell?  What?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I said I'm a dying man!
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
That was fun.  What now?
And?--And?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Hmm?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Any idea what he did?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
You can't.
Tell that to Muskie.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--you got more than one source?--
--no--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
So tell me about the Times article.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
But they both worked at the White House?
--I'm not your source on that--
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
--I saw him. He verifies.
--what do you think?--
--I'm not here.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Your name, please.
Are you sure?
I couldn't say.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
So?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Haldeman.  Right?
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
...okay...
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Not bad, Chris.
Of course, I didn't --
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
So we're gonna be close next year?
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Fuck me!  Yes!
You can crash at Stifler's?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad.
Dad!!
Michelle.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Well...uh...
Ho-lee shit.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.
That was a great night.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Feeling better, Oz?
So does your tongue cramp up?
...Guess what?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
What the fuck!? You too!?
Holy mother of God...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
We don't both have to die.
Okay. Be careful.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
What's the problem?
Uncle Terrence?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Jesus...
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Are you running away?
Who's Sophie?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
What?
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
What was that?
Hurry up with those papers.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Come on.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yeah? Allison what?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
The alarm clock.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Hi. Hi, hi.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Fifteen years?
God bless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
H'm?
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
Look, look at that guy.
Oh, yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
How is it any different?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
You're so sure about it.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Following is different. I was spying.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
David? You call your teacher David?
It's his name.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
M'hm.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oooh.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Commentary.
I can't.
Oswald and ghosts.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Well, sit down.
I don't know, I mean, I-
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Oh, gosh.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
I have a small window of time.
What?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Really?
He's gonna miss his flight.
That for us?
Sally?
What is it?
We live next door.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
A perfect night.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I don't think so.
I'm fine, babe.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
We've only been over this how many times?
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
He'll find his way back.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Happy anniversary.
I know.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes I did.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I'm a little nervous, so...
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
How long have you been married?
How do you do, Skye?
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
Yes.
God willing.
Oh?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Do Peter Sellers again.
If he were still alive, maybe.
It could be worse.
You see, that's worse.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Well, something's wrong.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Yes.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Hm.
So where should I put it?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Someone who follows his heart!
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Well I guess that makes us even.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Water...water...
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
And only you can become a Queen?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You new, kid?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Barbatus!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
So...you two are in love?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Why?
Twenty-seven.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Eight-thirty.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
No -- I like it.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
In his apartment.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
Who'd care?
I would.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
The dishes?
Fine. How's your eye?
How's everything at the apartment?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You do?
Sir?
Oh.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Well -- I guess so.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
You're going to take her off my hands?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
No I didn't.
On account of me.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
You can't come in.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Good evening, Baxter.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Me?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Want to tell me what happened?
It's regulations.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Family?
A.W.O.L.?
That guy really must've belted him.
Doctor.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Stop that, Fran.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
All set for what?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
It won't happen again.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
You're out of your skull --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Part.
Yeah.
So what happened ?
Holy shit.
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Probably is.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Our Recon flight ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
A lame ?
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Good swell.
What, sir?
What?
What do you mean?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
What's the furthest you been in?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
You can't have water after morphine.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Were you with him, when...
Yeah... thanks.
When?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
What will you do after the war?
What did you hear?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Right now -- I am.
Beverly Hills --
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
117  CONTINUED:  
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Avalanche season is coming.
...I won't let a killer walk!
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
How did she..?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What are you doing?
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
What's going on?
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Been driving long?
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
Told you I'm fine!
You broke the radio, remember?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Get the fuck out of here.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Why did yo do this for me?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
The stiff one eye?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
How you doing?
What do you want, Melvin?
What job?
I had to see you...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Was this supposed to be your room?
Uh-huh...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
How's Verdell doing?
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Which color was that?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Thanks.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
I told you to go on in.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Why are you doing this?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
You can't --
We go around once.
Okay.
What are you doing?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Why don't you tell me.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Sick.  The flu.
What?
Who?
Know what?
Deadline?
I know what happened.
Is this how it went, Nick?
A player?
What?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
What does that mean?
Yes.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
It looks like white's game.
You were like a boy genius?
Why did you leave the Agency?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
They tried to kill you?
I don't know.
What?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Yes.
Was that it?
I think I got one today.
Are you attracted to me?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Yes.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Martin.
Electra --
Why are you working today?
It's possible.
It's a common question.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
A dime.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
Yeah.
So how's your work?
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
What did the beer cost?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Care to elaborate?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
He was an electrician?
That makes you an expert I guess.
No....The Asylum!
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
It just happened.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
So?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
It's...42 56 76 .
Some deal you did there!
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
No, by road?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
No!
Turned Czech huh?
No way Doug, I can't.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Will it help to get you out?
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Can we charge admission?
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Okay?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Seems a shame!
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It was the biggest I could find.
I'm not sure it's possible.
No, just a drill.
But I have to finish this....
When the hell did you write that?
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Why are there still such headlines?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
With you.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
And I have no idea why.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Hypotheticals --
You do --
Deranged.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Were?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
I know you don't want help.
Why?
I'm an enemy?
I'll take a chance.
So what else is on this list?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Like you'd know.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You're not in a very good mood.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You're sometimes not sure?
We can measure wind.
I don't understand...
What would you do up here?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
Ergo?
What are you going to -- ?
It's gone now.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
What's Landon Carter up to?
No. I want what's best for you.
Like what, sir?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
You came here to give me my report card?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Hi, Marty.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
I'm going to be at the dance.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Your line, George!
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Eight thirty.
Pro, the sun's out!
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
So what? We'd be rich!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
How did you know?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
My guess is that she turned him down.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Hi, Marty!
Where'd you get them antlers?
What'd they look like?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Jack.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
I know.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't care.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You tired?
It was going too fast.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Just thinking.
Who are you?
Hold it right there.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
What crate?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Anybody we know?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Where're you goin'?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Pick those up, Reno.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
I want to know!
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
...Barton, is everything okay?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Yeah, but –
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
What do you mean?
Are you sure –
Hold on –
We gotta call the police –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Sure, Charlie.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
...Those your only bags?
All of which he's now missin'.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
How about the coke?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What was she like in school?
I don't need any help.
Did you leave the club with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
How did you feel when he died?
Because you didn't love him --
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Why does he do it?
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Did you think it was so special?
How's your shoulder?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
It teaches you to lie.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nilsen?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
You don't like punk rockers?
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Are you kidding me?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
She killed him.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
Who are you?
Hey – it's the big A.M..
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
These are great.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I didn't see you.
Not black.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah.
I thought you hated this place?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
Hi.
Come on.
You're a fast mover.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
That one's for you.
It's cold.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
"We"?  You and...
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
What happened?
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
... eight, seven...
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
And a very, very good one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Women.
What is it?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
I'm afraid to ask.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
That's gotta hurt.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I find that unlikely.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
How are you feeling, young man?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Why's that?
My life's an open book. You read?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
What do you know about obsession?
Like normal folks.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
But...
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
I don't-.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
How'd you find us?
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Take me. Let the boy go.
I know. I called them.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
What did you see?
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
Finding out where she is.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I've considered that possibility.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
... Thank you.
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Hi.....  Roses.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Annie, it's me.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Say that again, son.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Ahm....
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Sure did.
Yes?
What's gone?
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
What's your problem Beavis?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Uh... I think you scared them off.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Um... ass... head...
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Talk ta me, Bork.
You see what I see, Bork?
Cut the power!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
They make gypsies look good.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Aren't you scared?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
All right.  Who are you?
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Where'd they go?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
What do you think, honey?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes.
... And please call me Robert.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Oh, yes.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Would you care for a drink?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
I see.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Can you see well?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
I certainly do.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
Yes, Ben - he is.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
A flower...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. Of men and women.
I agree.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
How long do we stay in here?
Good morning, Louise.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
I see...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
... In the garden?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Try again.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
And look who you brought with!
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Look, Johanna...
Clearly, yes comrade.
No, sir.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Did you eat?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Tell her you need to see her.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I need a shower.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I know.
Maxine...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Yes, well...
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Who told you?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You're late.
You're evil, Maxine.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Yes?
What's the play?
Mr. Malkovich?
Do you mind?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Stay in him forever?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
What want ye, girl child?
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
Folks came.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WILL YOU STAY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
No. I mean work work.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Morning.
But mama..
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You remember your price, Stamp?
No, You looking good.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Why me, man?
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
I am the Walrus.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
It's already posted.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
What do you need that for, Dude?
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Are these.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Yeah, but my-
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
From who?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Oh?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Am I wrong!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Huh?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
What the hell is this?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Dude--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Not exactly a lightweight.
Is the car out front yours?
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
Yeah.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Did I urinate on your rug?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Yeah, but--
What?
You're hurt.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
Why?
Did you think I wouldn't?
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
You want me to hunt them for you.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
What took you so long?
Whistler, I --
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
But he's a policeman --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What do you see here?
Is it bad?
But you -- died --
How could you be a part of this?
Then what is it?
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
LaMagra --
Blade --
How?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
What do you mean?
Yes.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Why are we here?
--the witch kills children--
--<u>myth</u>--
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
How'd you know they were--
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Okay, a blur.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Me, too.
--Cotter: shut up.
Nobody's going anywhere--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Okay, but--
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
What--
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Dad...?
Sure. I'm sorry.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Yeah.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Meurice--
What was that?
...Huh?
Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...Ray?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
He needs a room, Dusty.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Sure don't.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
I told you. I like you.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...What?
...What kind of fish?
Right. Sorry.
What's this?
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
To your health, Frank.
Yes.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Not yet.
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
Jeffrey.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No. Come on.
Do you like talk like that?
Yes.
Oh shit.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Heineken.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You want to go talk to him?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Everything okay?
What is it?
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Go ahead.
Are you feeling okay?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Well. Okay.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
On the plane.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Honey, your nose!
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
What's that?
What?
Not really, no.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Because I got caught.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Good to see you, Diego.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Are you comfortable with this?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Well, you know.  It's um...
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Who's the cheapskate?
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
It's beautiful.
Freedom.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Dad.
What do you guys want?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Not in front of the kid.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Kristina's fine.
Yeah.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
But I've got school.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Second district ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No ...
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
I've been waiting for you to get back.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
The official cause?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
That's ridiculous.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Rebecca Lawson.
How did he look?
About a year and half ago.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
Why did she say she was leaving?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
October twenty-seventh.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What happened?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
I've been to a few -- yes.
You know I can't talk about that.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
How'd you meet Marsh?
It's not my taste.
Nothing.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What are you going you doing?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Hello?
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Alright, I'll talk to her
-- But it's Sunday.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
No, Your Honor.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Please -- not now.
It was a place to start.
Yes.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Lawyer here?
Yeah.
Michael.
'82.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Not yet. You want to go?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Madge?
You want me to call the doctor?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
I'm sorry. That was...
Francesca?
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Yes! Hi.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Okay. See you later.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Oh, how is he?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
What were you like when you were younger?
Yes, thanks.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
You feeling better Franny?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
Apparently just before her death.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Is it true?
Died there?  How?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Just some flies.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Looking to score?
I said, no thanks.
Jimmy, you've got --
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
We'll have to sneak in.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Why?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
And you believe her?
Bill!  Bill?!
You got the cash?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
We just thought...
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Evidence of what?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
The same way you did before.
The money!
Caesar!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
What are you going to do with it?
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar ...
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
We're going to need some time.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
You know he would have done you, too.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Not on duty, sorry.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
This is a beautiful place.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.  Of course.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
What?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Even though he knew about you?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Yeah.
What?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
An accident.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Johnnie, what did I say?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I know you will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
You're asking me a direct question?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
No.  We can't risk it.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Who do you think sent me?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Really.
Excuse me?
So what's in Paris?
You have blood on your pants.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Listen to what you want.
That's what I'm saying.
No.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
We're about an hour away.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
No.
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
xxxxxx
What about you?
Yes.
Where did this body go?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You drink rum?
...Be back.
What have you got there?
...Yer nostril?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
What do I have to do.
Go away.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
Layton! Oh shit!
What is it?
Am I?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Very smart.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You stupid bastard!
Is it stamped?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
Suit me?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Turn around!
I thought you arrested me.
We? Don't blame me!
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
What?
Yes.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Sam!!! 
Mistake?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I don't know which numero.
what? ... Oh ... 
Now look what you've done to him.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Can you fix it?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
No, no, that's impossible.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank Pierce.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He's better, though, right?
You married?
You asked me not to come.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Don't give me that look.
What look?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
What do you want to break?
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Oh, God, no!
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
You packing up tonight?
Eventually rising to...
A half hour in the lobby.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
We can cut back at the end.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
This is important to me.
No.  You know that I'm not.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Outside?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Almost immediately.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Nobody else had it.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
If we could just eat first.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I trust you.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Hi.
You okay?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Jane?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
So what did you think?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
What?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I knew what you meant.
This is very awkward.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
You really like it?
Let's see it.
Is it murdered man?
It's true, isn't it?
Thank you.
Goodbye.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter, I'm sorry...
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Just about anything, Walter.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Murdered...man?...
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Walter, what are you doing?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Where'd ya buy that?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
You're like an undercover guy!
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Well, I'll go home with you.
T-tell him that?
Nice game.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Wheels?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
You left me a message?
I didn't expect to see you.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Who?
I'm going to the dance.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I'm glad you came.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Ow.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Football is my life.
No THX.
So very much.
Why?  Why me?
You think so?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
What happened?
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You said "Crash".
You can learn to like it.
God, I never thought of that.
What?
The right nostril.  Good.
Death is like spring training?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'd like you to meet my father.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
He won't make love to me anymore.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Annie---
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
We gonna fuck or what?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Well, I held it like an egg.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I was great, eh?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
Boring.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I'm going to the Show.
Why am I a fuck?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Fear and ignorance.
And where can I go?
I ain't hitting a man first.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
What?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
You were wandering around.
What do you propose?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
702 472 1862.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
I can't! I'm tied!
Dad!
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
They payin'?
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Okay.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
In so many words, yes.
No, no it's okay.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Yeah?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Yeah.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
You go and put your things away.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
You've got to stop her.
Half of everything is mine.
...and she doesn't always -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Right away. Okay?
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
So, what'd ya do with it?
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Oscar wants you to call him.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I should have -
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Yeah, okay.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
I really think you're -
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Is this yours? Your pen?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
You shut up.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Well, I've been busy. 
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Pitch-black?! It -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He's not here?
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Mm.
Hi, Jennifer.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Thanks.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
A sponsor.
...same outfit.
Yeah.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Do you know that?
Listen...
Well, how come I laid nine?
Get up.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
I know. I know.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Charlie M.
You sure?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
She has a real spirit.
I better go report this in...
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Winning.
What do you want from me?
What did you say?
I loved you.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
I still have one left...
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Hey, Captain God!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Maybe.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Was someone in an accident?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Theo wants to talk again.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
And stop with the directions.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
A price on everything.
No.
Why tell me this?
Yes?  Yes?
Are you okay?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
You timed that beautifully.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
A typical fuck-up.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
You won't live to see it.
Twenty percent.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
We don't see you.
You'll see her.
It's in the process.
You should've done all this before.
And then?
Call me "Nels."
There's two police cars now.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
There's no lady here.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
It takes all types.
Jimmy.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Not in my experience.
Guy I work with.
No.
That should make her happy.
Hi.
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Maybe.
What would he think?
I think you do.
Do I?
He did sometimes.
No...
Must be.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Shut up.
Prescription. For my condition.
Good-bye, Dil
Died...
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Yeah.
And you'll never leave me?
Yes. Now.
Promise?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Need to go across the water.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Och, you do, Fergie.
You may be right.
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Dil!
What the fuck is this?
You OK about that?
Why do you want to do that for?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Definitely unusual.
Who is he?
I seen your fucking face.
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
Well, I could say the same about you.
No.
Best game in the world.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Shut up, would you?
So what's that supposed to mean?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Who's Dil?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I never know nothing.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
You're crazy --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Oh, you should see your face.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Then say it.
We? You mean you're --?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Thanks very much.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Describe him.
Steal it how?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Me? Why me?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Very good.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Do I knock or something?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
Scobie?
Does it hurt?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
Okay.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
You mean, you're a thief?
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it is important.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
But his mother --
You loved him?
About how wealthy would you say?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Yes.
Good for you.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Doing what?
What's going on?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
I wasn't --
How do you shave in there?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Be careful, Peter.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I believe what he said.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Do you know him?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Hi honey.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Your brother told us.
You fucked me up!
I am.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
What are you doing?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
You ok?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Did you want one?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Unfair?!
At least somebody likes this shit.
For cryin' out loud.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I got, like, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.

Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...-er!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...waiting!
...man!
Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Pete.  Come on.

These'll keep it cold.
...yeah.
All right, let's go.
...to him!  You don't know who...
...here!


Oh, shit!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Listen, Arlo...
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...man.

Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.

Come here.
Oh, shit.
  I've got the real thing!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...-tiatin'.
I feel faint.
Hey, be cool.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Well, that just about figures for today.

...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Thank you.
However, you are also non-en-...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...

...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...-lar.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?

...about--
You look good, Richard.
Grateful?
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?

...quick in and out.
What about these two?
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...noon.
Where's their protective...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
Quite a getup for jacking...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
...time to time, yeah.
...should be right outside.
Yeah?
...never done a thing for you?
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
...and unharmed, de-...


You'd never understand!
Goddamn it, Ma-...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Geneva just pulled the plug.
No sign of 'em...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
It's not over, Brynner.
 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
...is a perfect hunter.
...and that power...
...without caution...
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Dr.  Long!
 ...miles. 
...-son.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
You find yourself wearing a...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
 Listen, Pappas...
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, doc.
Gimme this god-...
Probably.
How did she get that idea?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Where from?
None.
Too bad?
What for?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
How did you find out?
Just find the girl.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What does this mean?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How much are you worth?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
You've got her? Where?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
They don't kill a guy for that.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Where's that?
Jake, listen.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Thanks, Lou.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
I don't.
Isn't that your number?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
What are you talking about?
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Where?
I guess not.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
That's not his apartment.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
What do you mean?
It wasn't much of a lie.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Mr. Gittes.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
What dam?
The Valley?
And Hollis knew about it?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
What about it?
And I want to know where.
I know.
She's too upset.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Did you get some sleep?
I want to see her.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
How about a plane?
Sophie.
I think I got something.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
He never even kids about it.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
Si.
It's not completely dry.
No, really?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
He's not in, Mr.?
He did or he didn't?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
She ran away?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
That's right, Modern Times.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
You weren't expecting me?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
Elena!...But when...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You don't really think so?
Go in and ask him to hurry.
I might make him nervous.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
He made an awful lot of money.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Ask them to sit down.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Hello, Brad -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Emily, you -
Get out, both of you!
You're no Venus de Milo.
A rooster?
How old did you say you were?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
No, you're not.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Thanks.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Oh, yes, sir.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
They do it only because you do!
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Brad, you are drunk.
Are you finished?
What check?
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
Are you sure?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Excuse me, but...
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
You're kidding.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Am I missing something here?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Well... kind of, sort of?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Sang? His name is a past tense?
You lie.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
He's not invited.
Who doesn't?
It wasn't me.
I'm serious.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
You open?
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Shit!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Your mother.
That's frightening.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
So?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Thirty-seven!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
You know what pisses me off the most?
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
We're not playing in the street.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
What happened to all the Gatorade?
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
You hardly knew her!
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Then how come you got the fine?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're a snake.
What time did we go to the funeral?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Thirty-seven.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
You need a ride?
Get the fuck outta here already.
I am not.
Yeah.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Yeah, but...
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
At least they weren't lit.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
You're trusting.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It better be up to and including me.
What the hell was that for?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three?
I'm not the pig you are.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
He requested this?
That's because I never had sex with him!
Lower your voice!
A few?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
It was only a few times...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
I don't want to go back with her...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Randal...?
That's tight. Solid.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
I will. Take it easy.
Did you catch that thunder?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
I copy.
It can't fly in this weather.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Enough.
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I know...
You couldn't.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
He doesn't want my help.
What are you doing here!?
What about you?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
It was great.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Go after her.
Where's the rest of the team?
Oh, my God!
Ask the questions.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Richard Travers.
Been punished, yeah?
I've been cured.
Good evening.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well - I'm back.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
But it was horrible.
Yes!!!
Good. What do you want?
I was quite enjoying that.
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
What?
The ride is free.
You like Bach?
This your current address?
You still carrying passengers?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Jesus...
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
You know Dmitri?
Federal?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
So?
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
What?
What about that?
How about the thingy next to it?
You said you were visiting friends!
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
Jazz.  Music.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Let him go, Vincent.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Don't start.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
I'm sorry.
Doesn't cover everything.
Gimme your wallet.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Well.  That was brilliant.
They said send you downstairs.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
What's the charge?
Switch the charts.
People do have heart attacks.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
You saved my life.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
What is it with you and the space program?
So why are they after you?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You want something to drink?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Has this happened to you before?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
My father's house.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
What about you?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Thank you.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.
You've asked me that one three times.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Which way did he go?
I want to believe you, too.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Tell me.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
No doubt.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
What?
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
This is how you see the sky?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Could we hear to the moon?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So we passed some kind of test?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The systems integration site.
I'd say this is slightly different.
Ellie.  Arroway.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
But what about your research -- ?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Ellie -- are you okay?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't follow.
It's getting late...
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
What?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
They don't believe me.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Git movin', I said.
Buck is a deal.
Comin' out here, Boss?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke. Where you goin?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
That fool. That damn fool.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You get me out first.
Where is it?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Is he out?
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
How do you know that?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
That's no surprise.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Maybe you should...
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
Just get out of your vehicle...
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
You messed with the scene.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Detective Niccoletti?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
It is?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
So - why the airport?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
No.
You're kidding.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
Crash victim?
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Patient.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Please, Letty.
What do you think?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Lie?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
By color.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Tell me all.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Not a one.
I better make a list.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Hey.
Not yet.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I love you so much.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Sure. Why?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
No, you've done a perfect job.
I've met someone else.
Who?
Getting back.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Zero.   That's all I know.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
You're there now?
Oui.
Oui.
Uh, yeah.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Okay.   How much?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They're gonna be what?
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Hopefully no one.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I'm going to kill him myself!
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Can I trust you, Sami?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
What?
Okay, we're square now, right?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
There has to be.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
It's good.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
You ever hear of jet lag?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
You ask a lot of questions.
Sounds boring.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
Yes.
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Don't bother.
Put them down.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
A murderer?
It's Jade Fox!
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
No onions?
Could be.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You gotta go now, I bet.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
In a better place.  I hope.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Neither.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
No shooting.
Who got himself what?
"Our" Crow...?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
You promise not to say anything?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
What'cha reading?
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
How are you today?
And you promise to abide by it?
What?
How was your date?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Please don't go.
You don't know how to love.
But you knew this was important to me.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Schwarz. Jewish?
I don't think that bothered him.
Are you shitting me?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
I'm in the bath, mom.
What are you scared of?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
I... I don't think you want to know.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
He made you give him a blow job.
What year are you in?
You think he'll like it?
And then I can go home?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Yes!
No.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Sorry.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
You would not believe what--
Yippy.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Morning.
You didn't?
I accept. Now get out.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I can't thank you enough.
You will be discreet about this?
Let me get that for you.
What do you want?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
On the back street — a green house
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I know that.
Where did you get it?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
I don't know yet.
I'm your friend.
Can't you get it, darling?
But you must!
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I wasn't singing to myself.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
What?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
George bit you?
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Maybe they have to pee.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
At least your PMS is over.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
No.
Peter knows something.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I really gotta pee.
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Oh, it's nothing.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Briefs.
What are those?
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
You at least owe me the truth.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
What about... those guys... I might have...
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
You want her sheets?
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
You think mafia hit?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Not really...
Just visiting my patient.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Please, they'll kill me...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Good.
How can I submit this?
What?  Who has?
Then we must call the police.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Your name is John White.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do you know I'm innocent?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
No more than the usual.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
The Washington Post.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
Like how?
Up and around?  Soon?
We think so.
Clean.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
I don't think so
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Choices?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
I'm afraid so.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
In the car?
Dave...
We've got to fix this.
Why?
The Fidelity nonsense...
Yeah.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
No.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
What's that?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You1re leaving, too?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Hi.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
What about the intro?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
His madness....could be from shock.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
It's because of me.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
I think he's sweet.
Nuwanda?  Please?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
This is stupid.
You fucked up little prick!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
A yawp?
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A crazy madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
You really think I should forget her?
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
What is this, a midnight study group?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Who?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
How soon can we get up and running?
Hanover, listen...
What other bunch?
I'm not a thief.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
You people...rich people...
Quite a few.
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
It's okay...come on...
I don't know...you got what we need?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
She fucked me.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
You don't!
Whee-uu!
Yeah.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Naw.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Biederman!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
How's the trailer?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?
Up north.
Who the hell is he?
No. No, no.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
What'd he say?
Promise! You gotta promise!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
You wanna bet?
That's it. No. No way.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Right.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
What?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
You didn't get a deer?
Never one.
You're full of shit!
Up a little there... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Funny guy.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Does it drive itself, too?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
They're going to rob that bank.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Married?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Wanna try?
You treat her nice.
...Have you been drinking?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Bye.  Thanks.
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I didn't.
You're lying.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Why? It don't hurt.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
You are afraid!
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Not long -- now.
Headache -- Squire?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Oh, Jabez.
Mary -- it's gone.
We must go on home, Jabez.
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
Well -- I -- I-
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
I am going to lock him up.
You know that, son.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
You'll be a father any minute now.
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
You aren't angry with me?
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Hullooo!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
The past six months.
One of yours?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
The code key, please...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
Yo!
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
Oh...Where does he live?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Holly Gennero?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
Roy?  You still with us?
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I'm really shakey.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
You're really crazy.
I like that... yeah!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Are they on the phone still?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
What kind of things, Leon?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
They're okay.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
What do you want?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You're full of shit ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
We like you, too.
You all right?
I'm glad it's okay.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Let's go, Sonny.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Does that still go?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Bullshit!
Here's your document, Sonny.
We can't stay here.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Morning.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
I've already formulated a plan.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Stop it.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
Cool it, Choco.
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Ya back is got.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
How long?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I'm coming.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Let it be broke.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Hey!  What did I say?
Can you pay me now?
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
I work too, but I still make time.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Where are you going?
To get my money.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Keep dreaming.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
No, I'm not it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Excuse me?
Ooh gross.
What are you wearing?
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
She did not.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Hey, where did you come from?
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
Who?
You certainly did.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Cute puppy.
I made the polar bear pants.
I... found that rock.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
That's not your tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
That's my boyfriend.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Do we have a deal?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Have you got what I want?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Will that be on the midterm?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
And...?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
So, this is Leto the Just...
Yes, Sire.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Did they try and fail?
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Are you sure this is okay?
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
You'll be sitting on the right.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Don't worry.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
I've never seen anything like him!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Toss us out on our ass.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Like <u>what</u>?!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
You're a fuckin' mess.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Hruphh...?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
My eyes are killink me.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
You can't talk that way about my movie.
You look beat.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You don't wanna be noticed?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Who?
I'm moving out.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Ed, can I see you a second.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yes, Ed.
Yeah?
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Take him off the air.
Al!
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
Who?
She left.
What are you talking about?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Are you asking me?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Cream rinse?
You do though, you look great.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I wish my stepfather was here.
I really like you too...
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
What's up?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Screw off.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Me?!
You know what your problem is?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Can I help with anything?
What does that have to do with... ?
Yo --
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Yeah, just --
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Yeah?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I know.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
I guess you know why you're here
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Yeah.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Doing what?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Which door?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
People can see this.
I know.
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thought what?
Yeah.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
What'd I do?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Are you sorry she's dead?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
You fuck for money.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Yeah, I hate them.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
How's it going to look on your report?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
At least not anymore.
Ellis Loew.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Of course...
That's right.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Anything?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Man, what're you saying?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
Dudley, we've been over this.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
I want you to follow Bud White.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
You sound like you mean it.
When?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
A sweet man.
My daughter was a virgin!
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
What's he doing here, Sid?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
It'll be our secret.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Yes.
Um...who's that?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
What's going on?
That wasn't so hard.
Drive.
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if--
What if--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What are you dialing?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's a little late for that.
Pardon?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
You tell me.
No.
Bobby!
Something bad happened tonight.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Well, you know--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
It wasn't me.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
That's okay.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
Who?
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
That ain't me.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
It's how he works.
Other than me.
Bullshit.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Your shoe.
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Really?
He's kidding.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby--
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
How'd you get in the building?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
You sing.  All the time.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
When were you most happy?
What?  No!
This is - what is this?
Why did you hold his collar?
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
Don't leave me!
Safe journey.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
In my room.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
How are you?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Hello.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Right.
Apprentices.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Are you asleep?
Could I have a cigarette?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hey! -
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I don't think so.
This is wonderful!
Kip?
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
That's doable.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
I don't want to waste your time.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Those are my clothes.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
On what? Another job?
A dozen times.
We're working.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
Hmmm...44 long.
You've got everything planned.
The Mask. Where is it?
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
A parting gift from the Empire.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
The disc is still in there.
Jesus.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Remind me why.
Suspicious, after all these years?
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
She's calling the shots now.
Call it an expression of trust.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Jesus.
You're a lawyer?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
The judge came up with a number.
Yeah?
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
Oh, yeah?
Course I did.
And you can't?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Erin --
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
And, what, I'm not serious?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
I was wrong.
I did.  Both.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Two million dollars?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Whose number do you need?
I do.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I didn't say that.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
What's going on?  What are you doing?
I can't leave my job, George.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
There's something else, too.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
The boy is our last hope.
You must survive, Luke.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Growls a reserved greeting.
Howls.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
What are you so grouchy about?
Yes, Your Highness?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
I take it back.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Now you're making sense.
How do I look?
You mean a man you can control.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Are you kidding?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
I'll take what's mine now.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
We have no use for your kind.
What'd you say?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
But I feel The Force flowing!
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Free your mind and return he will.
The Hoth System?
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Believe what?
Please
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Ooww!
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
What?
What's the little black box do?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Location.
Where are they going?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Me too?
I don't know about this thing.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Where?
What are they?
No screamin' shit.
What the hell is this?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
All of us?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
I want to thank you.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
But, I'm here.
Father...
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Why?
I will run.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You provoke me, Merlin.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
I didn't know that.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
I see, your excellency.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
May I ask...?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Good morning Madame.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
She used those words?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
He didn't mention?
I beg your pardon?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
You could do it yourself...
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Have you told him what's happening?
What?
Oh look at that.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Well I heard differently.
I don't know, I just thought.
All done.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
I came to say goodbye.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
You might loosen the straps then.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Do it again.
What's that?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Oh really, when?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
...look down in pity...
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
You're not going to drive.
It's our goddamn car!
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Accident?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
How we doing?
Jack.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Only on odd days.
No, I mean it.
Jack.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
Talk.
I'm not unhappy.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Jack.
It's early.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Okay.
Unless you want the right.
Yeah.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Doesn't it matter to you?
What the hell are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Fine.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
April.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You always threw up.
No.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
I don't know. Some disease.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Stay off it.
Fuck you.
Right.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Five years ago.  November.
So what'd you think?
The flu.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
My watch is broken, too.
This is show business?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Nine?
What do you think?
I don't believe it.
Great?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Some discussion.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Thanks.
All right.  Hold on.
No.
It went well tonight.
Where's egghead?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Forget it.
You were good.
Friend.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
Vegetables.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
Looks old.
What's a prom?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Were you there to catch me?
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Not anymore.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Kim?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
I'm not going anywhere.
... That's great.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
How’d you know my name?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
C’mon Jack...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Finger food...?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we finally being honest?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Where were you?
Why not?
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Say it, Jack...
What...?
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Good things...
Think bigger.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Not with what they pay me...
You can’t go!
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Not by a long shot.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I found it!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Those yours too?
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Ben.  Are you okay?
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
So are you!
Apparently I can disappear.
Sweet.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Yes, thanks.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
'Scuse me.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
I'd hold that off awhile.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
It's only for an hour --
Just one, General...
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
A long time, with one man.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
At an operation?
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Sabotage? I don't understand...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
What'd you do that for?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
How's it look?
What do you mean?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
...Blood has been shed.
We need more -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
I unnerstand.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
White Bear Lake?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
...Yah, okay...
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Yeah, but -
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Brainerd?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
...Dad?
It's okay, Scotty.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
...Dad?
Yah.
...Who they playin'?
lot. It's a limited -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'?
We might be innarested.
Yah.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
You're darned tootin'!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Well, that's okay, I just -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Uh-huh.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
...What can I get ya?
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Margie Olmstead?
...Hello?
What'd he say?
No.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
The day of our homicides.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah?
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah, I guess.
Oh, my.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
The dynamite...
What does that mean?
Who do you think could've done this?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Why are you doing this?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
What... ?
Make sure.
I could check your prostate.
Chloe's dead.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Answer the question!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What... ?
I'm sorry, I...
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Who's this?
You were in here last Thursday night.
My suitcase was vibrating?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
...no ...no ...
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Huh?
Thank you.
A nice, big cock.
How do you feel?
The fight.
You're sure?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
You know what I mean.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Four in Milwaukee.
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
...stop me?
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
Can't you call it off... ?
Not exactly according to plan.
NO...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
What?
What?
Very good, Sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Really?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
I'm not sure I understand.
Carter.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
What?
What was the fight about?
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Stop it, don't move him!
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I'm... really sorry.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
4:25.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
No! No! Don't!
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
No.
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
You read me, Brewer?
What's this?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Yes.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Yes you can.
Why me?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Typical...
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
The moron?
And who's Lydia?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Tragedy?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
I... I was just leaving.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Your name was picked.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Where -- ?
A quest?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
So what? You going to help me?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
You a fag too?
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
You're married.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You're not going to play it again.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
It brings out my eyes...
Come on.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
Hey, mack!
No substitutions.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Tea.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
What?
Well...  I better let you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yeah, me, too...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Yes, intentionally.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
Why?
You had no inner feeling?
I don't find your language that charming.
No, don't do that...
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
That's three games to none, Carl.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Miss Dupea.
Fine.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
You know somebody around here?
You got a boyfriend?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Who gives!
Eddie from Compost?
Wha'?
How does he look up close?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Positive.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
You mean her.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Sonofabitch.
I wasn't asking.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
My God, you're serious.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Well, which one?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Like tonight.
What, the heat here?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
My lawyer was a bum.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Check.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
We can't talk about it here.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
My hero.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute young thing, too.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
I bet you do.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Lunch...
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
What is this?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
What does all this mean?
Act natural.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
They just left, sir.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
You want I set up?
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
So you're saying she moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
What...
Fletch, you want an apology?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Actually, you may take it all now.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
I do it for love.
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
How'd you get this from her?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
You okay?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
You okay?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, you were right!
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I'm off it!
Well, hello, Ford.
You'd said something about proof...
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
He is not wrong.
Where from?
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Hey, Bo.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Baltimore?
Hey, bud.
Hey, bud.
About what?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh.
Frank, please...
Okay, start pedaling.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Where are you transmitting from?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
Huh?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
29 years...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
No wait, don't go!
I lost you.
On the job?
It did, Pop.  It did.
Yeah, it's me.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Whatta you mean...
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
How you feeling?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Hell-
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
No.  I got here just before you did.
This is too painful to look at.
Why did you come back here?
You promised you'd never ask me.
My whole world.
Bullseye!
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You don't "have to."
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Oh, jeez.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
Are they grown-ups?
Boy scouting.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
Anything else?
I know who you are.
Twenty.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Get up!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Her name's Stephanie.
It was a community service.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Until I hear the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
He bought you that?
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
That was truly excellent.
Tell me.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Dear Christ...
What are you doing in here?
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Rennie...
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I didn't mean for you to go!
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Say it again.
Shut up, Elliot.
Press a button and they give us money.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
He carries a gun.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
This could be it.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Because we're completely mismatched.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Why do you need a radio?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
First you tell me.
What else?
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
How prominent?
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I don't know.
Don't worry. It's a test.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
Sidney remains optimistic.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
But you're his friend.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Just an admirer...
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
"Hell!"
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
You're an ambitious man.
Are you going to walk all the way?
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
All right. Fine.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
We don't have the manpower.
What are you waiting for?
What's wrong with him?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Where?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Again?
How long?
Hello?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
I was at home.
So you didn't do it after all.
What about the car?
Come on.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Promise you won't laugh.
At least you were outside.
Doc...
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
You're full of ifs.
I want to say something.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
You and me.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
You're crazy.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
That's right.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Where?
Sure am.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
I know.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
That's not good enough.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Where's he living these days?
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Do you?
Really?
Really?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Who's setting you up in this place?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Expect so.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
That must be interesting.
At me friend's house.
Where would I find him?
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Nowt.
See you later.
Ta.
Is he staying the night?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
What you doing around here then?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
That's right.
I'll see you, then.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
I had to.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Well, I think I had one once.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Shoes, boots, yes...
With River Oaks?
That's right...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Someone should hurt them.
How many leads have we got?
As a "robbery"?!  No.
No.  Not actually.
Did you talk to Graff?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
...and rob the place...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I do?
And why is that?
I, you know, they should be insured.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Yes.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
...what am I going to do all month...
He said we...
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Where was I?
Why?
You think so?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You're done, come down, and let's...
What about the other two?
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...after the thirtieth...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Murray said...
Murray said...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Either way.  You're out.
...they kicked out.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Excuse me...
No.  It hadn't.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
The check's no good?
Why?
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Oh!  For the magazine...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Yes.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Three days.
To change our minds.
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
The power to negotiate.
Fuckin' asshole.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get my contracts.
They got, listen to me...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
John...
...Mr. Williamson...
On your pillow.
To do business.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Is Kay coming?
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Ready, Frankie.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
We were all upset about that.
I never met them.
That's what I'm here for.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
What?
Chi?
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
But if you're wrong...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
Mike, at three and a half...
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They are everywhere!
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Good.  Then you're staying.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The room has a bug in it.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Senator Kane.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why don't you sit down?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I know.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
He don't want to talk?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
What about Michael Corleone?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Thanks, doll.
It never crossed your mind?
I'm not a kid.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
You ever been married, Hanna?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I don't know.
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Yes.  Perfectly.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Sure.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
How are you?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I knew you'd say that.
Sound it out for me.
Get out --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
No...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I'm on the move -
Not my girl anymore
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Double-meaning intended, right?
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
You mean the poor --
What about him?
No. That was Higgins ....
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
Dignity...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You, too, Ma...
No.
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He's in some trouble ...
What time of year?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
"Shadow games?"
Dad'd be proud --
Price of doing business...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Now what -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
Call 'em here -- ?
What's with the look?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Hey.
No way ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
I think so... They're just... So ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
The hard part ...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
We've got to help each other.
Where's the stuff?
What happened? You okay?
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He heard.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
How's the woman?
What?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
You and Morgan throw?
You're kiddin' me.
Jesus.
I told you, I just got change.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
What's up guys?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Seven.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Yes.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
--And confuse him--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
So I hear you're taking some time.
How about one now?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Probably not.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
You've never been on a plane.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Hence, the word remarried.
What?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
No. Thank you.
See ya.
I'm Will.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I want to meet them.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Want me to take a look?
Do you play the piano?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I can't go out to California.
Ready, Pa?
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Gallon or two?
What'd he look like again?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
So long.
Women?
Can all of you work?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
That cut you got?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
They're all gone--or dead.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
Women is always tar'd.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Get to what?
You been acrost?
This here's a strike.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
No'm.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Didn' you get no sleep?
You promised, Tommy.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
He was a good man.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Yeah?
Tommy?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what does *that* prove?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Yeah...
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
What?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Yes.
Seven it is.
You're fucking psycho.
Flowers. That's funny.
...Let me get my coat.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
...About five years now.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Do you like the people you work with?
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Thank you, no.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
No harm no foul.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
He using her.
They're not happy, sir.
I have scruples. Next.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
To shoot you. Correct.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
How are you? How's business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Doesn't matter.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
The answer's no.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Everything under control?
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
About what?
What are you talking about?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Great!
Who's there?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
I should go get some of her things.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
When are you coming home?
Oh, I don't know...
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Why do you always wear that hat?
I wouldn't let happen.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
No, not yet.
What stuff is that?
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
She's rabid, but cute.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
I want it to have my children!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Go fix the phones.
Did you talk to him?
Dade?
Up all night again, huh?
That's bullshit.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Fucked if I care, man.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell are you doing?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Alright, so what have we got?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Excuse me.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Yo, what's up?
Any questions?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Send a Flu-shot.
Thank you.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Just one moment.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
So?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Brady!
Shit!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Why shouldn't I?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Got it Earl.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Jamie, wait for me.
No.
We'll hear sirens soon.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Do you?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
It isn't a man.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Car trouble?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I wasn't spooked.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
I wonder where they went.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Promise?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Jesus!
You have the wrong feeling.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Laurie...
I promise.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
Let's make more popcorn.
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Hi.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Oh, is that what it is?
It's French, though.  It really is.
Yeah.
Uh...
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
We're actresses.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yes.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Like what?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Yeah.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Yeah.  How are you?
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Not because of me, I hope.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Mm-hm?
Aren't they great?
She has all the cooking talent.
Great idea.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I am... I did slave all day.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Like what?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Who is it?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Oh, great.
Come on.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Oh...
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
I think so.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Ohh?
He's married...
Oh?
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Oh, gosh.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're crazy!  That's not true.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I was so bored!
Yeah.  Me, too.
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah.
You're kidding me.
Hmm.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Well, what about me?
I am.  You-you made my day.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Hi.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Some museum director disappeared.
I have not read you your rights.
What have they got you doing?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
C'mon, pal.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
What do you want me to do?
No.  And...
What would <u>that</u> be?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Yes, I did.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
...standard issue...
No. 
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Of course, Commendatore...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
If your duty requires it.
How could you know?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
...what?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
I don't understand.
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
She must be something special After Dark.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no.
Yes.
...sir...?
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
...sorry...
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Hey.
I think your passion is terrific.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Where did you get these?
Very very. The photographs?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Killing her won't solve anything.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
What is this shit?
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
We're breaking up. I am out!
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
If you'll excuse me......
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
What does old Stew want?
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
It doesn't matter.
This.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Mummy!
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Of course, yes.
Second most common?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
What's the occasion?
Hello I'm Dr...
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
What?
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Hey buddy!
Do you know where you are?
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Dreams?
Are you ready?
It's not that kind of date.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
LaPlante!
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Bill, listen...
He waited for you three hours!
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Yes.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
You were... very... inspiring.
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
It's not unthinkable.
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
So where are all your toys?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
What happened?
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Stop knowing me so well.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
We're going to think about it.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
That's not the case.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Lieutenant?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
This ties in with Nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
What?
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
You?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Must you do that?
If it came down to it what would you do?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I'll go first.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
I would like to say goodbye.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Huge.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Because it's my name.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You didn't answer my question.
Is it?
Yes -- it is.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
No.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
We found him this morning.
It has to be.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
What are you doing?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
No.  The money, please.
I think he's dead!
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Talley.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
You won't die if you let me help.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
We're fucked.
What are you talking about?
I got the gasoline --
Donuts here any good?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
Where is it?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
How can we get out?
Are civilians inside?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Is something wrong with Jane?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
You want me to stick around, I could --
Let it go, Captain.
Go, Mickey.
It's mine.  Talley.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
We're okay.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
What is this about?
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Give me it.
What was the response?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
Your police are at the gate?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
What do you mean George?
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
How much?
Your brother's here?
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Has Roger spoken yet?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have a confession. When we met...
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
What's wrong?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What is this about no water?
The staff and guests! How many?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Can I help you?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So what stopped her?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Jesus H. Christ!
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
You're not my list.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
This is nuts.
Oh, Jesus....
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
I'm better than that.
Thanks.
Most fun I've had all day.
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
What are you looking for?
Run.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Steven --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
The lockdown thing.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Ghosts killed your father?
He must've unsealed the room!
For the love of God....please...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
A few years older, perhaps.
By killing them?
It's going to hurt us!
We're going to go someplace new.
She says she's lonely...
She's here.
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
What is it?
Whoa there...
A friend?
Oh my God where is she!
You're bleeding.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I think we should do it.
Maura.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Your daughter's been taken.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What's going to happen?
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
And what would you do?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Something bad.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Then tell me what to do.
Wha .... ?
Uh-huh?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
What?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Uh-huh.
A prize?  For what?
Yes really.
But you gave me a rose ...
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Something like that.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
We're going in from the ground floor.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Don't you just hate kids...
What the hell....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
And I'll bring my entourage...
Prison?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Where did you get this?
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Trust Leonardo....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Bunny, not you too?
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Snappy.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
He didn't offer you money.
Hungry, anyway.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
What a beautiful thought.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
I filed it yesterday.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Muncie.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
And Sid says you stole it!
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Geez, I --
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
I haven't had --
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Not even behind your back?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Ya get the special?
She finds him.
...Her mother needs an operation...
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Alive?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But don't you have to work?
That doesn't sound like him.
But she's not dead, Wes.
A mental case?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Why?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Right o'.
You're staring at me.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
I'm, uh, going to bed.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Don't start.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
If you're going to insult me --
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Elena.
I'll drive you --
Ben--
Here.
Birth control.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
What you been up to?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Educated guess.
Yes.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
That's right.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
But not too ashamed.
Reverend Edwards.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
What?
Huh?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Yeah.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Mikey?
Geometry?
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Charles.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
Hey Wendy.
Yeah.
Good.
So far.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I know.
We're sure it's hers?
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Fred Duggar?
Will...I...
What if someone finds out?
Huh?
What kind of stuff?
Since grade school.
I don't know.
What was?
Down at the station?
What the hell do you know?
Are you the leader of tis group?
What are we?
Then there is nothing.
But why?
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
What plans?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
He jests.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Then my luck would have changed.
I can't do it.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
You're sure?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Dear God, what have I done?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
As did the one who made me.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Where are we?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Lestat - finish this -
Unless I make her one of us...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
What about coffins?
Did he die in the fire?
You're in 201 and 202.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Stupid. Stupid.
What are you doing in my closet?
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Yes.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Pretty cool bar.
Hello?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You guys lost?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
Take this.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
What would I be thinking?
Yes?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
What is her illness?
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
But they're somebody's children.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Yeah, very funny.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
George Bailey.
That's the kid.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
What's that?
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Well?
Today, over at the house.
Hi, Daddy.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
No.
Aw, forget it.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Uh-huh.
I'm not very good at this.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I'll take it. And then what?
Have you made up your mind?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Would you rather leave?
To keep from being an old maid.
Is it snowing?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
I guess you forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
How fast is enough?
Don't!
No.
Shut up.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
I can't let you take her out.
Untie that rope.
I'm going out there.
Pop....
Hey, come on....
Mike?  Is that you?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Look at that:
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
All summer?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Are you serious?
Someone has to do something.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
That's it?
That's what he said.
When?
Dad!  Dad!
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
No class.
Maybe it's gone.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Figure they split?
How much longer?
What is it?
It comes here from Cable Junction.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
You're going out.
I want to go with you!
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Go on, you're tired.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
How many sharks have you killed?
Well, not much longer to go.
Not enough loving.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
Recovering nicely.
They said you'd be here.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
What do you mean, we don't?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
You can get killed!
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
Not good enough.
He's missing.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I'm a water-skier.
Besides that.
The one that goes underwater?
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
What?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
No, South Georgia.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Five hundred yards.
I'll go with you.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
Thea....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Can I make sandwiches...?
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He was doing his job....
We need milk....
How come it's my responsibility?
No....
Off....
Henny Youngman....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
I'm hungry, Mom....
I'm just getting started....
You're not a pain in the ass....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
It's late....
It got him....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Can you just go off...?
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
How can you just take the plane like this?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I can't....
Yes I can....
Come on, Hoagie....
Inch by inch....
Stop farting around....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Forget it....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
And it's always worked?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long has he been here...?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Stop that!
No way....
Jake.
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Jake... 
Cow tipping?
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
The <u>dogs</u>?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
No, you didn't.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What do you want it for?
Did he shut you down?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
I guess by the bed.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
How do you know her hair's black?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Three or four.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
You must have some idea about him.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
The elevator wasn't working?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Have you been here long?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
What does that mean?
You think John would like it?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Okay, this is working.
Well, no you didn't --
Look, I don't want a --
Well, thanks.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Oh my God.
We will be fine!
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I'm relieved you said that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Oh God.
What --
And I really don't know your noises yet.
I don't know --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
Not right now, Jerry.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Now you want Arizona dollars.
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
I'm sorry I asked.
That's an answer.
What --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
You okay?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
You said "fuck".
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
We can't just...
What?
Nothing.
That one time was just the bumper.
We should try fishing again.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
That does sound lucky.
A well-accepted theory.
Eric, your parents are both here.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Are you sure?
No. I couldn't see.
Billy!
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You are an academic.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
John . . .
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Which one?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
How close do you have to be?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
What's he got in there?
No.
I think she's with Sarah!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Oh my God.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
And what are those?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
It's all right.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Dino droppings?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Tim, are you okay?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
All night?
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not funny.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Mister Biller?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Well?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
So?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Uh-huh...
Not yet.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
We're down to seven minutes.
What happened? Where's Jason?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
You look like brothers.
Just what you've published.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
Will you do me a favor then?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
... My ... social situation?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you ...?
What of it?
You don't believe that.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
I've heard of it happening.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I'll bear that in mind.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Women are all you have on your mind!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Look -- could I use your phone?
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
So do I.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Why?
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Arlyn Page.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Yeah.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
That who?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Have you discussed this with them?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
We grew up together. Kids.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Mr. Kramer?
The prospect of losing my child.
In real life when does he hit you?
What if she forgets?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Then eat around it.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Yes, your honor.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes...
And how did you find his work?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
No.
No.
Is that...permanent?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Only can I still see him?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Yes.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Fine.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
No.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Hey, that's terrific.
All quiet?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Soon.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Holiness?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
How many?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
I will not go.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I leave tomorrow.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Much too young.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We are here on official business.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Is this a trick?
This is a setback.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
You ready on shore?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Eh.  Fuck it.
I'm okay.
Kelly Scott.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Why are you here?  Really.
You okay?  Kelly?
That's probably good.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Ssssh!
You're mushing it a little around the--
He's floating.  Take it home.
Well...
If I'm ever in New York...
Different worlds, Jack.
I wouldn't.
This is a little different.
Seconds.  Three, four.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
You threw it at me!!
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You like Jack?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Kelly--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
You and Kevin.
Kelly--
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
You're all right! Where is he?
I don't know! Get me out!!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
That wasn't me.
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Who's the subject?
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
But if he knew we have so little time -
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
It's much better than your shoes.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Then please - do this test for me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Ahhh... Why?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
By the book, he's a sadist.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
The death of my father.
No. Tell me why.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
Early. Still dark.
Yes...
What...?
My God, you've grown up.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Your "father"?
Maybe...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Ottawa!
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
What happened to you?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
What is enough?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Their arms?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Jesus Christ...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Your suit, Becky!
How do you know it was Williams?
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
That was a loud one wasn't it?
What are you doing?
The internal monitors read normal.
Something wrong, Cobb?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Bullshit.
Who cares?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
What is it?
It needs blood?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I'll kill him!
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
How long has he been in there, son?
All right, Dad.
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Well, what's going on?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
What's left over?'
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
Six.
The money, the gear!
Leave your sister out of it.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
So you knew this young man before?
You're dismissed.
That the word on our boy?
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
I never met her.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
You going to get married?
Mikey--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Pleased to meet you.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Right.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Eladio Cruz.
Is very beautiful, your car.
This girl has a child?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
That's a matter of interpretation--
Right.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
And Buddy was one of them.
Hey, Sam.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Thank you.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What?
It's Saturday.
Can I get this?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Morning, Sheriff.
Three months.
Field trip?
Most people did, yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Yeah?
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Yeah--
I been working on a few things.
Just doing my job.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
So when did Buddy leave?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Nix?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Right.
Why would I do that?
Who did this?
About?
They won't tell you anything.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
No.
It's okay.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I was so afraid.
What was that?
Bad show last night?
What makes you so sure?
You believe that?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yeah, I know.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
A Mister Quaid?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Yeah.  You could say that.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Where'd you learn that?
You know Vinovich?
Have you been in?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Oh yeah?
I don't know what else to do.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
This is where we killed him.
I don't know.
Call me tomorrow.
What?
Nix! Nix!
And he's dead?
Why would I want to?
Yeah, they told me.
Oh.
Hi again, how's it going?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
I don't want to go home.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
You made it.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yes?
Yeah, its really different here.
Uh, no.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
What?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Oh, come on.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I don't know what to do.
See you later.
Do you think it's done?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
You never said anything to me...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
What're these?
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
It's nothing.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Is he going to be okay?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You fucking bastard.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And also that...
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
We needed to know all we could.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Nothing.
That's not funny
So what do I do?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's ridiculous.
The blue.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Sorry.
You might be the only one with a job.
To do what you love.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I found you someone.
Too many times.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Thanks, Sidra.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Well, what do you know.
What's up, Sidra.
How's that been?
For real?
I never knew a girl that could play.
What do I have to do?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
What's that?
So she's honest.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
With a jacked-up attitude.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Yeah.
Forget Tonya Randall.
Who was that?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
Hey, what's up.
Least you got your priorities straight.
You're what?
What do you mean?
No.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
What is this?
Later when?
You scared me.
Guess he talked to you.
Quincy, please...
What?
Tell me what?
From your mouth.
What do you want?
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Please put your clothes on, please --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
That was so great what you just said.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
Say what you want and you'll see --
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
C'mon guys, settle down --
How much time do we have?
-- Richard.
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
Picky, picky.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
And how much is braces?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
...cocksucker....
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
No.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
All it takes is one second?
Let's talk about --
Are you asking me that?
In aid of what?
She lived in Tarzana.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Hollywood, mainly.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
And "Frank?"
They wouldn't?
...are you Phil...?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
How long...you think?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I am calm.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
I live alone.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Willa Cather.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I'm a bad person.
Rose, I don't --
hey.
Well maybe.
Yes you do.
They look pretty smart, I think.
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Shut the fuck up.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Yes.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
...what...?
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
More wine!!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
We go someplace dangerous.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Do I look all right?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
Athos, please...!
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is that?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
... Two-thirty-seven.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Sire, I --
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Shall I leave?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
You mean shut your ass down!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Let's roll -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Alright, where is she?
Are you alright?
And what did he do to the girl?
Something I don't already know?
No.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What happened with the tape?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No -
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Are you going to be alright?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Ditched you?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
You said the guy down here is good.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Run it.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
Wait, Will...
What's it narrow down to?
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
How did you come to Gateway?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
You'll let me go now?
Come in.
No.
In a holding cell.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Okay.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
'Intimate? !"
Hello, hotshot!
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Will? Are you okay?
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
You going back down to Florida after?
Lt. Fisk said...
Yes. Who are you?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Pictures?
What were the yards like?
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
Pretty well.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Hi George!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Really?
Excuse me -- ?
Popcorn?
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
I'm gonna quit.
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Excuse me, Andy...
Are you sure?
Positive.
"Burlesque"?
We had a deal!!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Then the informant is real.
What?!
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
He had an accident.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Yes.
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
... Yes.
You could say that.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Do you understand, Neo?
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
Did you believe in them too?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
You're the Oracle?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
But what?
What?
Hello, Neo.
How do you know that name?
How did you do that?
Of what?
Why?
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
What does that mean?
Why?
What?
You don't have...
Where is it?
What do they want?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Neo, this has to be done!
Cypher, I thought --
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Neo!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Sounds good.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
Well the guy over there said...
I gotta get the stuff.
Can't we come with you?
And say what?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Nah.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
Hey...you got nothing here.
I could have told you that.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
OK, ok...
Nope...
Hey, shut up.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
A paper on that one too?
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
I know...I know.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
What, honey?
And you could care less --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
That you've been to Susan?
Paillarde of veal.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I would prefer some peanut butter.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
I didn't say.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Cold.
What'd it say?
As close as a deal could be.
Is there any more to it?
Shall we adjourn?
No.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Whose?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
I from dat nex' place.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Don' be facety, woman.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Yah.
Rass!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
The Board is waiting.
Yes?
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Whatever you do.
I am, too.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Girlfriend?
To bed.
Almost.
You're here?
I love you in an evening gown.
We know all that we need to know --
Don't.  That will come later.
Did I say that?
The 'coffee shop' --
I - uh --
I'm still here.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
You think so?
How long have I got?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning, Bill.
And what?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I don't know.
About Susan?
That's okay.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Yeah.
Then what is it?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
I don't!
What do you mean?!
'Take me'...?  Where?
'The one' to do what?
The 'question' --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Good morning, Dad.
How did you know?
Do you love Drew?
That's all?
Are you okay?
We've met.
Nothing.
Then what is it?
Where is he?
This is crazy --
Where's he going?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I love him.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
That's it?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
Couple days.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Thanks.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
So you have information for me?
Such as?
Did you?
Help me.
What?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
I don't think so.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Shut it, Teddy.
What's wrong with this one?
Unfinished business.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Why?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
What was it for?							   *
Lemon or lime?
No.  I was in Namibia...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
Tell them what you want.
How many?
Where's that?
The Keys?
Were you born in Havana?
No.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
When?
Where would I go?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
What'd Neptune tell you?
Yeah?
What's our deal?
And there's Dmitri...
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Okay.  What's up?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
...and thanks for the flowers.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
And...?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
You're hoping to get a look at what?
What you gonna do back there, East?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
For what?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Where'd that come from?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Don't say nothing about you either.
They wrong?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Instant V-goddam-D.
What?
Sixty Lira?
Would you recognize him again?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Just got some news on Bell.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
What lawyer?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Look, I showed you my badge...
What?
Its muscles are locked.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
What?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
The scent won't last...
No...
Hello.
Gross. What is it?
What's this?
What is it?
It bit you.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
Then who did?
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Misery's Return?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
What about a bee...?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Why would you lose me?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
I thought you were going to dinner.
How grateful?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
More like two-two point two million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
What are you talking about?
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
I wouldn't do that.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Where do I meet you?
No.
No.  Should I?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
I do.
I don't.  No exactly.
Let's start from the inside out.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You have Bellerophon.
So what do you suggest?
All ten million.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
What are you going to do?
Max made a deal with you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You don't think we're going to make it.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Whoís dead?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
The arms dealer.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
What sector's the air conditioning?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Such a nice ass.
No, I'm going.
The Shawfish?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I don't know what you mean.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
What are you doing here?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
I'm going to marry him.
I'm making you a steak.
Just Johnny.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
Me neither.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
You don't get along with anybody!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
That was just so... awful!
This is your place.
That's right.
I'm really afraid.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Will you marry me?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
How was your plane ride?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
No.
Did he tell her?
I know.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
So.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Who was that?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
I'm a housewife.
I don't know.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
Well, who is your lord?
Well, how did you become king, then?
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
And not too expensive.
None shall pass.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Who ... Who breaks out?
By what name are you known?
Too late.
What?
Where?
It is the rabbit.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
Yes.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Sorry ...
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Thanks very much.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
I don't want land.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Leaving the room ... yes.
Yes?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
I don't think I was.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Stop saying the word!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
Sixty.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
I'm getting dressed.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
What's this?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
A situation?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Mother....
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mama...
We --
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
That can wait till the weekend.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You sent for me.
See what?
In time, she will.
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Mr Brown.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
I am told so.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Cold is good!
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
Who told them that?
There is one other matter.
Then why are you not with him?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
It's twelve-thirty!
Something's happened to them.
Where do we go?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Shit...
What?!  There's nothing here!
Christ...no time...
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Mom?  You're alive...
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
What's going on, Cynthia?
But I'm not broke.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
You're an understandin' fella.
... What??
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I told ya.
I was afraid of that.
Very pleased to meet you.
Betty.
Yes, there was.
Number 17.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Maybe it's not me.
I'm not sure about this.
Do you know them?!
But I want to.
And who are we auditioning for today?
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Betty Elms.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Not a coke or anything?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
So what do we do ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Where are we going ?
That was eleven years ago.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Is it over ?
Is it over ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When will that be ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Of course.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
The power went out in half the park.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Really ? On a date ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I'm talking to you asshole !
How's your foot ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
You want me to move?
Visualize a spare?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
What does that mean?
I'll be back in 137 hours.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
She just had a baby that's all.
Maybe he's wet?
What're you saying?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Special effects?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Thanks
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
You would.
Boy, you're really into this.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Just give it to me!!
In the tar??
You mean,  this ring?
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Hey look!
No?
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
You want me to come with?
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Something wrong?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Why not now?
He's a great poet.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Keep your voice down!
Ex...ex, ex...
No.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
You don't like it?
I wrote that.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Did she ever see Vada?
Want to what?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Can we see it from the back yard?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Pointing upwards Look...
Dad??
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
I like the freak show.
Hi.
What are you doing.
Did I kill my mother?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Do you miss her?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
This is one big house for one single person.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
No.
She's shy.
He's allergic to everything.
Hi.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
NO!
I'm hemorrhaging.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Oh great!
At what?
It'll bleed.
What?
I am not.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
I dunno..
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Close your eyes.
Umm, Ummmmm
What?
What?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
I give.
Two words.
Well, we're...
Excuse me?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
So... one almost has to...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Uh, Kimmy...?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
I never want to go through this again.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Endearingly absent-minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
The Big Hurt, huh?
I never forgot that.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
You got the money?
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What do you have to buy?
Don't feel that way, honey.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What did you say your name was?
You going today?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
She's going to rest now.
She's fine.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Third party?
What!
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Whose?
National television?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Where are you going?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
He's my father.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Parts.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is thin?
When did you think it would happen?
Oh.
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
What?
Yea.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Do you study at all?
You go to school together?
You do?
You always live there?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Are we in a big hurry?
You got something you want to do?
Looked like an interview to me.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Tell me about the purity.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yeah baby.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Take a wild stab!
That's my opinion.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Want to talk to you.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Yeah.
I been sendin' her money.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Where's he at?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Your folks live there?
What d'you expect?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
I like a place with lots of life.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I wouldn't have let you.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Surprised?
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What about him?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Don't, Duff.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Okay.
Where' you goin'?
Like what?
What happened?
How you doin', boy?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
No, they won't.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
And then?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Yeah. That was me.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Ready?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Can you take me to it?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Where the hell have you been?
Yo.
How's the ice break?
What about the route to the core?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why should I want to meet him.
What's my end?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Holy shit...
I gotta know... did it work>
Case... Are you alright?
What is it?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
College?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Well excuse me.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
You don't think I can do it.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Senorita Josie.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Wow. It's packed.
Wings?
How many times have I fired her?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
A flack jacket.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
wasn't even thinking about-
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Please. Please don't walk away.
Why?
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Well, a ball player.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
Not at all!
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, please...
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
So, you feeling anything?
What do you mean?
About what?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
It's gone now.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
So, school going alright?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I'm serious.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I used to live in this house.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
It's over.  It's over.
But nightmares are the common thread?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Didn't get much sleep.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Try me.
What are you talking about?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
That was such a great evening.
God, that's an enormous arse.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
No.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
What did you say?
No, you were brilliant
You've got to go.
Why?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
This is the place.
I have thought about you.
You like Chagall?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Excuse me.
Anna Scott?
... get fired.
What?
I'll see what I can do.
Any bit in particular?
That's right -- Topol.
No, it doesn't.
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Well?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Hey.
Two?  That's it?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Fabulous.
Bad news.
So?
What book?
But you have no proof.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, ma'am.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
A vote is before the group.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I hope everything is settled.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
B-B-Billy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-H-Help!
In ya go...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
What for?
It's the questions she asks.
Ya know what, Fred?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Giving up?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I refuse!
What's this?
I wanna see it...
My turn.
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
I don't, Doc...
How are you feeling?
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
After you, ma'am.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
What's that?
I thought so.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Oh no.  Do you?
No.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Thanks.
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
NO.
So it wasn't real.
Why not?
Why?
Nice dress.
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I was hoping for the real thing.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
What looks good?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Is he gay?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
It's still the new year...
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
What are you doing?
A phone message.  Only--
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Why?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Yes.  He is.
And you are?...
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Where is she?
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Then don't.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Don't say that!
Don't say that!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'll get home all right now.
You know how the Sisters are.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
How do you like it?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Terry, you're bleeding.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
You are like—
About Edie?
Give me that gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You still call it ratting?
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Such as what?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Count this.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You want to know somethin'—?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
The ropes are coming loose.
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Then cancel my order.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Then why do you shake so?
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I said not as a rule.
Lie face down on the floor.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
It's Richard Ripley.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Whatta you think?
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Half for doing what?
What?
We made it, didn't we?
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
All right, but...
Sure, Daniel.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
How much for your company at chow?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Let's go outside and talk.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
I mean, romantically.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
Oh, God...
You like taking risks.
So she did help you?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
If you don't, one of those guys will.
You just did, for Christ sake.
So.  What's your point?
Take your sunglasses off.
I see better with them on.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
You know who they are?
Thanks for your help.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
I'm not leaving Midge.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
And is Foley a part of this?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
You there?
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
How's it going?
What do you want?
You like to sit down?
Got run over by a car.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Dad...
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
You here all by yourself?
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think he must've fell in.
...the fuck is this...
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I'm out of ammo!
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Then wh-where do we land?
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Danny's not coming?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
We're all going away.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Brilliant, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
They're waiting. Come on.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
It's that jerk Walter.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What are you doing here?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What're you doing here?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
I love you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Oh, God, Dion.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Hi, Dad.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Quiet today?
He'll win.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Would you get that, dear?
Where have you been?
What does Charlie think about that?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
What was?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Will you take of f your blouse?
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I think so.
Is this a good spot?
It's weird...
You ever think about running away?
How long have you been here?
I know, Mom.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
One hour!
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Continue.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
What do you want?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
What kind of person is that?
I suppose you could say that.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
No.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Absolutely.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Where's Dad?
In what way?
Objection!
Why are we going to do that?
We won.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
How many gays do you know?
Joe?
Yeah... ?
Right.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Back to the ship, huh?
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
What do my eyes see?
Not sure. Ten?
What, switch what?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Didn't bite.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
Let's just be sure.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
79 kilos.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Well? Is it just the pump?
What, you're goin' off, too?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Frightening thought.
SULEIMAN!
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
So much for your nightfall.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
How did you know we'd come here?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Where does the river lead?
What's so special about him?
'I am not a missing link.'
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
This place is dirty, doctor.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
We got off at the wrong stop.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Why special?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
It's him...Landon.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Says he can't walk.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
What?
...But what'd she do?
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
And you, do you believe?
I'll go with you.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
I volunteered.
No, thanks...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Merle?
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I really don't know.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I haven't been invited.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
I didn't notice him.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
All right--following me.
Why?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Do you have to leave the note?
Frozen.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Me?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
FLorida?
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
If I understand what you meant by that.
You understand perfectly.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I don't want to talk.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
We know everything.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
You asked for it.
Name it.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Why not here?
And without much discrimination.
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
I never notice the view after the first week.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
It could have been an accident.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Lay off, can't you?
Mr. Mitchell.
I don't think you locked your door.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Now, you're being beastly.
How about Magruder?
That leaves two strangers.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Get out of here!
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Of course.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Congratulations.  Who with?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Are you going to have coffee?
Freshman and sophomores...
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Oh yes?
How nice.
Again?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Not here.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Hello, Jimmy.
No, thanks Dad.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Where?
You gotta earn trust.
What's this?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Got it.
Aw shit.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I'm serious.
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Nice place.
I... I gotta go.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
What story did you give to Davis?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
What's got Billy so spooked?
You're looking well, Dutch.
What's that, General?
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
It's... it's not like that.
Nice car.  Yours?
What motel you staying at?
What's your name?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Off the boulevard.
And why do you say that?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
What do you like?
By breaking up a company's assets --
What are assets?
Vivian --
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
It'd cost you.
All right, two thousand.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Hello?
You liked the guy, though.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
No.
Real genuine guy.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
I got tired of hating my father.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
We're letting them slide?
Give me twenty minutes.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Kit give me nothin'.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Niece?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Then you would use your--
Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Thanks.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why is that, do you think?
Hello.
-- where?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
I brought you a special present.
-hold it, hold it-
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
You want me to read this or not?
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
No.  To the pain.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Now?
-- yes --
What? What?
Hah?
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Go in, get after her!
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
Yes.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You've made your decision then7
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Have fun storming the castle.
Guess what.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
But that's cheating!
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
We swear it!
Not.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Do you need us?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Feeling better?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
People can hear you.
Where are you going vit the light?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
What?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
If she paid you well?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Of course not. Please.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Please!
What's the matter?
A good reason, I suppose.
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears. 
I ought to call the police right now!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
It's been three.
I feel better when you feel better.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Yes.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
What is it?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
You can't go up there.
We could laze around here a while longer.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam, let's go get married.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You have something most girls never have.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
No.
You'd know, of course.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Phoenix?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
No-
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
That's it. You get it quick.
How do you do.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Did you? Where?
I won't let you say that!
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
I used to be married to one.
No kiddin'?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Good night, sir.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
I've been dreaming about you.
What universe are you in, Paul?
What did it want?
Yes?
Is Rose here?
They're filthy, Mother.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Here comes Daddy.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
Well, it's not very plain.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Why is it taking so long?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
How could that be, son?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Your baby?
No, you're not.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
What's the matter with him?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Yes, go on.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
I'm just saying...
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
How you doing back there?
You don't smoke.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
There probably is.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know... you could say thank you.
You know what I mean.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
That's not true.
How'd we do?
Come again... ?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
The gang's all here!
Yeah.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
Yoda spoke of another.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
Luke.
I thought she was with you.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Someone who loves you.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Over there! Two more of them!
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know, father.
Come with me.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
I will not fight you.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Hello.
You know this earth - this person.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
"Sweet Transvestite"
On the day I went away.
Are you - giving a party?
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
I don't think you're a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
It's not that --
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Like?
Don't want weak legs.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
I can't go out.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Owe you what?
Get that doctor.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya sure?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Did you hear what I said?
...Screw you.
Hey --
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
...Who'd ya fight?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Please, kid.
Whatta you get outta this?
How you holdin' up, kid?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Bullmastiff.
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
I'm thirty myself.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
I'll do okay.
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
I didn't know who I could trust.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Have you got the will?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Me.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Wrong number?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Romeo! Romeo!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out--
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Good heart, at what?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Hold Daughter!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet!
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
I thought all for the best.
Is she a Capulet?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Who the fuck are you?
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
I better be getting that.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
It's quite satifactory.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Shut up!
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
We'll double your price.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
Do you have it?
We'll die if we stay here!
Is it done?
There is one other thing...
Don't cross me...
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
So what is it you want to know?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark ops?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
How could you have done that?
You think?
Give me a cigarette.
Business keeps you on the road?
In a minute.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
And now...
What's the story?
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
I can't do that.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
You think he's bluffing?
No.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Well, I don't know...
How much?
None of us like it!
Shut up, Jesse.
Hi.
OK.  I love you.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
You're worth every last penny.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Hello.
Anything...specific?
Shopping here?
Sure.
Jesse?
Hey where's the hot pad?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne put the gun down --
I'll settle for a third of that.
I'm not asking.
How's work?
This whole place?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Invitation, please.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
How'd you know?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No.  It's my first time.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
No.  It's not right.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
It's your turn!
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Who's Benjamin?
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
I did!
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
What is this?
First class.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Right....
He was trying to kill me, not you.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Don't go there...
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Stooly.
You talk too fast.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
You like it?
No, fish is a PM food.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Yes.
Hello.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I still have work to do here.
I will not have friends in America.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Thanks.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Originality is my speciality.
Getting nervous?
Twice...
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Too much.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
I'm a work in progress.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
What!?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Yes, you!
Yes, I did.
Used?
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
You're a goddess!
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
But I'm weird.
Lighten up, what?
He's going to be the pastor?
No, I'm just going to head home.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
-- who's married to --
Am I what they had in mind?
Nope.
What is it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
And then I'll see you in New York --
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You should write something about this.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
You're going to miss the train.
What are your plans in New York?
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Please --
Are you Annie?
Howard.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Magic.
Mom, we already...
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's me?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
It's a spice rack.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Stressed.
Somewhere in the middle.
-- a slice of pizza --
Will she scratch up your back?
Whose show was this on?
This one's for both of us.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Hi.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
It's a little derivative.
What do you mean?
Is he there?
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Where you going?
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Sun up.
No.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
What are you saying?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
No ...
Well, if that's possible ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Yeah.
Now that's down-right insulting.
It's not that easy.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
What happened to your eye?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Who is it?
I don't want to leave you.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Twelve
Nice day
My features. They're Finnish.
Sorry.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
You wanna score some go-fast?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Now get talkin'
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Cool it. We got business.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
I was trying to score some dope.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
This the guy?
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
What's on the other end of this thing?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
So, where are you from?
No kidding.
Yep.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Glad of it.
I've been humming it.
Some.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, can I ask you a question?
There's always a bright side.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
I don't like that one.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
I'd like to go, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
How do you do it?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Yeah.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I told him to be himself.
Wait a minute.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I love you dad.
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
I'm fine.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Yes, I...
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
That's right, work it out.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Alright.
Yeah.  What a day.
Busy?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
So it's an honor?
Yeah.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Nice one.
Won't you see me later?
No.
Be friends?
Yeah?
Then why are you shaking?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
Did you talk to Corey?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
The truck?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just her name.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Give me my firebird keys!
Now you're back.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
That'd be fine.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
That's very generous of you.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
I can do it, Captain.
Can't we hold him?
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Shit.
Yes.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It helped me realize one thing.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
This is exactly what I don't want.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I see you read the book.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
You broke my heart.
And Joel's pre-med.
Dewey?
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
What do you want?
What about rehearsal?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Gale?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Do you want to die?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Who?
Jesus Gale what happened?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
You used to say that was our strength.
Always.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Do you want us to come with you?
What's your point?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Geez.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Let's get out of here!
You're not happy with your part.
Huh, fine.
But you know my favorite name?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Who the fuck is this?
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Nope.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
I thought she was dead.
Yes, sir.
Oh it did?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
You know that's not true.
What?
NO! Don't believe him.
What number are you trying to reach?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Hello.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Gotta go.
To talk.
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
So you better leave.
NOOO!
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What are you doing here?
Any word on my Dad?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Stop. Right there.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
And what would be your motive?
Wanna another beer?
No way.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Take a message.
I don't know...
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
No, I haven't heard.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
What the fuck is going on?
I... I don't follow.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Who said this was murder?
This doesn't make any sense.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Nothing.
What?
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
And so what?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
We need a warrant.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I don't know why... why now?
Are you absolutely certain?
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
You should look into private schools.
Did the wife confess?
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Because she's my...my...
But I just bought a good blanket.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
They never find that girl.
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
I got to fetch her home...
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Why else?
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Martin, it's not funny!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Oh
Do you know that house?
So what do we do?
Where is the play?
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Do you know it?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I have lost my gift.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Can you love a fool?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Oh
Moonlight!
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh--no, no!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Your name?
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Wait there.
Your aunt?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
How do I offend, my lord?
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
Will you shut up and play.
Think about it.
Is this necessary?
I want to secure it.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
What does it look like?
That's it, then.
Know and love?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
I don't thinkI can.
OK.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Will you calm down.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
You're frightened.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you know many of these people?
No.
No.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
You know about it?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Offering it for debate.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Do you think George is a fairy?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
What do you expect me to do about it?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
What?
I don't know.
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
Wow.
I gotta talk to you.
Nummers.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
You're looking great, baby.
But aren't you...
No.
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Chopped liver?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
No shit.
You think that's funny, don't you?
That you're just like your mother.
How is she?
Great.
Great.
And you need money?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
How long you had this?
You did, I know you did.
Yeah, baby...
What about it?
-- we can't now.
You were great.
Where do you want to go?
What's wrong?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- It's Malone's.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Wanda...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
How are you, baby?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Honey, what happened?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Yeah, baby...
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
What do you want?
I know, honey.
Ha, ha.
I don't want to fight, George.
That was him.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- yes.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
What did you say?
Thank you.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
This really ought to be layered...
Layered?
I wanna hear about it.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
I mean, how did that happen?

Come on by.
I'll call you back...
I'll call you back.
Okay.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
George is going to open a shop.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Of course not.
Here.
Aren't you going to have one?
No.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Poster-Kleiser.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Well, he is.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Well, what is it, honey?
-- Yeah, honey...
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Oh. thank you.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
That bastard.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
You seem disappointed.
Call me Les.
Dad?
Yes?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
What?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Maybe he showed me something.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Red Rum.
Tony.
Sure.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Of course I am.
Stop it!
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
What's that?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
And you listen to that?
How are you doing.
What? 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
What is it, Mary?
Pay attention...
What?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Wet behind the ears.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
JUST SING!
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
A novice.
Excuse me?
Experience!  Right?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
St. Anne's?
Are you talking about me?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Is this all the food I get?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
What are you doing here?
You saved my life.
So I don't shop.
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Really?  Lieutenant?
I can't go with you.
What?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Vince -- is she... okay?
Not... totally.
It didn't work, Vince.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes?
Is this like your old convent?
He's decent.
Reverend Mother?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
What is that you wear?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
What is it?
We are leaving.
True enough.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Lady Van Tassel...
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
If you want.  But...
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
No, but... why do you ask that?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What... what are you doing... ?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
What was that?
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
You... you are alive.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
What do you like to eat here?
French-fried potaters.
They was a boy. We made friends.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What numbers do you punch?
Why? Hi, Karl.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Hey Karl, you off work?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
No sir.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Mama?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I'm ye boy.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Right now?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What's the difference?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Two, right?
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
And these?
The refrigerator?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And have you mended them?
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I owe you something.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
He's dead?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
Yes, please.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
That's obvious.
None.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
How long you have this detail?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
And her farmhouse...?
Sure, anything's poss...
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Such as?
You're welcome.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
I think they got me.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
What message?  What motorboat?
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm engaged.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
I'll say there is!
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
We'll take a rain check.
I'm a very sick girl.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
We don't have to run.
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
How did you get that bracelet?
Yes.  For a whole year.
- and you got to be girls.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
We can have it altered.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
What's in Florida?
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Thank you.
Who are you?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Shell Oil?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I am?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
I don't mind if I do.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Nothing at all?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
What is it?
Me?
What's the matter, Sugar?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I come to the old lady's funeral.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You don't owe me no nothing.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except it’s Scotch.
Christ, Amy.
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Mom, please.
She did?
I thought you said you were crap.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What’s his problem?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
No, tell me.
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
Why?
Who are they?
It’s cute.
You shit!
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What about Sounder?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
But, Charlie --
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
You bet we is!
You feel alright today, Daddy?
From Miss Johnson --
Sunday...
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Ready to go, Mama!
Poor creature...
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Who's Miss Johnson?
It's the heat.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
I wanta get some things.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Is there something I can do to help you?
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
My head hurts.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Pillow.
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Who the hell made up that law?!
No you can't Kenny!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Goodnight, honey.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Viva la Resistance.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's the password?
Guess.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Stan!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I'm needing lunch.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
The F word?!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
And ze rope?
I think we're moving.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
No, just enjoying the view.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Sorry about your loss.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
- canker sore.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Like this?
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Do you know where they're taking him?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Won't your father help you with that?
Mind if I cut in?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Sheila, please.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Where are you going?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Fuck plan C!
Some unfinished business.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
There's heat coming the door.
Norman!
Yeah.  I heard you.
Nobody move.
What was that?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Storm?  What storm?
What?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- Wait a second --
What team?
Harry's missing.
But sir --
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Going active.
I see it.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
It's chipped.
What?
She wired this system.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
What sub?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Wait -- down where?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
Yeah, it was awful.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
That wasn't in there before.
You think?
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Manifested?
You think, in the sphere --
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
It's getting cold.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
I never went in that sphere.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Stop it!
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
I --
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Where's it coming from?
I don't follow you.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You remember opening the door?
What is it, Harry?
Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
You don't remember that?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You didn't say that about the food?
I don't think so.
We're never gonna make it.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
You know how to work this thing?
How's that working out, by the way?
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Four.  Four years --
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
I'll get the information.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
You could put it that way.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Here come six more... grid two!
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Who's the pilot?
No!...
And you?
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
What an honor...
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I don't believe it !
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Johnny, wait...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
How do you feel about him now ?
She's flying starships !
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Carl can wait.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Should I be ?
That was just a mix up.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Report.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Guess you gotta go.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Mr. Rasczak.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No, sir.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Good for you. Go find out.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
<U>Why</U>...?!
<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Answer</U>!
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
The point... 
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Sure plan to.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I need a typewritter.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Why?
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
...such a pleasant sound.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
What happened?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Hi.
The other side.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Hi.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Lookit that, up already.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
We on for tomorrow night?
What, what what are you doing here?
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
Where have you been...
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, where do they hold court?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Wat...
This horse is booked.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Bourbon and Milk.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
I'm very sorry to...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I think he's moved...
I love Jewish men.
Claire, when did you...
I just...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yeah.
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
-- she's got 'religion.'
Who got their heads cut?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
Hi.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Town's out of lilacs.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
So be it.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Is that one hell of a kid?
...it is?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
We have to lose the window.
Why?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate when you say that.
I'm gonna call him.
Like how?
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'll miss you so much.
This is my house too!
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
Help me here...
Great.  Big ears, too?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
That's Rache's song!
Ben where do you have to get to?
It's not good enough.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's temporary.
We're going to win this.
Look, I...
...in.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
She's devastated.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
And her...?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
But?  But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Restless.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Hey.
Like what?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Really? How many?
No, Mikey.
I'm always working.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Was anyone in my room today?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Oh. What happens now?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Get the hell outta here!
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Thanks.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
I dunno...
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good.
How many?
Scooby?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Whoopee.
Prnceton.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Is he with the girl?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What are you talking about?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
She's as good as gone...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Dissent?
Are we adrift--
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Thank you, Admiral.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Where are you trying to reach him?
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
What are you talking about, Major?
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Yes!
What kind of trouble?
General Schmuck?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
That's right, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Then there's no chance for recall?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
What?
Call them every five miles.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
They can't touch us at this height.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
I've got one.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
He's dead.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Can I have some?
Was it okay?
What's it about?
Your a nurse?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Sorry.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Ah!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No. Life is too short.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Erica is in the van back there.
Look.
Buff...
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
No, no, no.
You better! Yes!
I will.
It's safe, come on.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You okay, man? You okay?
Okay.
What'd he get you?
Really?
That's what I mean.
I'd love to read that.
Two-fifty.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Who were you talking to?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Oh! Trim it!
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
About what?
Like what?
Your completely missing the point.
It was a racial incident.
It got that close.
Jeff. Jeff.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Well, what about us?
Hey, Pony.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Like songs?
Really?
What?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Look Pakeesa...
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Yeah?
No, she was just sitting there?!
You're not serious.
I can't believe you're still here.
No, I'm going.
What's that supposed to mean?
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Just one?
So where are you?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
She thinks you went to the police.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
I'm sorry.
Shut up.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hello?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
All of you!
Good party.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Is there someplace we can talk?
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
This is where you live?
Whose?
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
Get out.
Just a minute, you!
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Who?
The other guests?
A little.
Keep it.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
That's what I told them.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
We've come for the car.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
What is the scene? Where am I?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
What do you want?
Western Europe.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Just like that?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
But what if---it wasn't real?
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Why should I believe you?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Did anybody notice you?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
No, MR. Danvers.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Where is inner space?
What is this place?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What? Palace? Hardly.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
What are you talkin' about?
Tuesday.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
You know what's the problem?
I didn't --
Call me.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Kent!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Yeah.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Wipe 'em out?
How do you do that?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Fair's fair.
For what?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
I know, by computers.
Who's the other woman?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
There's no rush.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Where's the handle?
85,000 dollars.
She's not his mama either.
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Who ????
I'm listening.
I'm sorry.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Everything on it?
Gee. But --
You'll miss the battle of the century!
This way Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
My kind of people.
Sensible enough.
No possibility for parole?
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Shhhhhhh!
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
I'm not so sure you do.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
And what do we get out of it?
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I think there's an angle.
Who?
Whoa. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Thank you.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
It was hot, yes.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
No.
What now, my love?
Huh?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Listen...thank you.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Nuts. He made it.
Krypton!
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
No news is not good news. Y'know
You're not going to hit me?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
-- as we will be.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
I came to talk to you.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
It must feel great.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Which one?
I...don't think so.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What are you thinking?
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
About the Ottos?
From what?
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Excuse me?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
Isn't it a lovely day?
It's interesting.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
What's vermin again?
Yes.
Nicole?
So he was mean?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I have no questions.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Yes.
Yes.
Some more wine?
Are you expensive?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Yes.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
You remember that much?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
You mean it?
The ramp?
It's okay.
The door needs a lock.
Are you sleeping?
She'll move away.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
But Charlene...
Will you mind your own business!
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Does he have to be here in our hair?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Can I come in for a minute?
Match me, Sidney...
You print them, don't you?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
What about?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You ought to be used to me by now.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Like you?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
No one must follow your work.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
I'm very sorry.
I guess so, sir.
Where you from, David?
So, what does the Russki want?
Five minutes.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
No. Ours was damaged.
Major, Major... he's here ...
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
And what was that?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Yes, von der Null.
This is absolute nonsense!
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Do you know what's in this archive?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
The what?
You volunteered?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
What about it?
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
Send a unit.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I'm so sorry.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Oh, God... !
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
They'll love that.
You deserted me.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Can we talk?
They're watching.
Then, what good are you?
Get us out of here...
What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing?
I saw them kill him!
Nicholas...
Shut up!
No...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Don't move, you bitch... !
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Yes.
They'll be wanting it back.
About me?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Call that number.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Fun?
You dodged a bullet.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Yeah.
Split it?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
There's nothing to forgive.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Humor me with specifics.
And if nothing's lacking?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Didn't I give you two?
You did?  How is he?
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Your ex-wife.
What gentleman, Maria?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
It's not going to hold your weight.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
It was very specific.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Like she smelled it too?
Welcome Home.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
When do we take the tests?
What do you want?
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
Fifteen dollars.
Not really.
David.
Why?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I like the colors.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
There's been some trouble downtown.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You broke last time.
Oh really?  Where you from?
Been to the Boat Show.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
You goin' back inside?
Uh-huh.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
What was that, then?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Weren't you on a television series?
Modelling.
When did you get in?
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Are you serious.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
You don't seem bothered.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Only in the movies.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
It was you.  Downtown.
Of the deal, man.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Don't you work with Ian?
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah, that's right.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
There is?
Something's on.
How'd you get in here.
Since when?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
Who's looking for you?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Boy.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...I guess I've been all wet.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
No problem!
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
How ya doin', Ed?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
How much to they want, Dave?
...You know... who *who* is?
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Told what?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Dave.
Honey.
...Doris--
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
Will anyone else say they knew?
Yeah.
No thanks.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
He a good man?
I'm fine. Thanks.
...So, uh, who should I--
...Did you make that up?
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
What'd he say?
Mr...?
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
What's the combination?
Battery's dead.  Shit.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Apparently it's huge.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
This place is a maze.
Got my hands full here.
What happened?!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
What is it?
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Something tried to get into this room!
Where is that?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Argo!  Hobbes!
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
I don't understand.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
They're all heavily armed.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
One.
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What happened down there?
What music?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
The memory of who?
You take Japanese.
I've got to talk to you.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Truman, that was our house!
There's been an accident, Truman.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'll try.
The whole area's being evacuated.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Brought on by what?
This man's still alive.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
How's that?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
You know my work?
How?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
You told me you had answers.
You didn't know my father --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
How's that?
No you didn't.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Where would they be going?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
This is weird, Mulder.
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
Scully...
I can't go any farther.
I don't know anything about that.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
Mr. Mulder.
Is she alive?
About the conspiracy?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
What alien environment?
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
I did, yeah.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
COME ON!
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
Agent Novak.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
He has a little dog.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
In German?
Do I...
What are you going to do?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Oh, well.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Must you take those?
Yes, of course.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Well?...
It wouldn't work.
...excuse me.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
What's that?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Did the police believe you?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
...you.
The Roumanian?
Hear the details.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
Mr. Martins...
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
It's on an island that no one get to.
One kilometer
So?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What??
What, do you like it here?
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
I told you, I'm good at this.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
A poison...?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Who killed Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Don't tell me what I --
How have things been going?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
A Jewish prayer.
Open it up.
When do you want it to go off?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
You remember Miriam....
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Dennis Leary.
Howard Stern.
Funny?
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
We tested the new bomb.
Eat shit....
Oh, fuck you...
What do you mean?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
You're right.  You're fired.
This is a great pleasure.
Is it a poem?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
How did it happen?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Is he here?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
No.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Why?
Everything about what?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
... How long was I asleep?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
... I was right about what?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
A drink to warm up?
Tea... or whiskey?
How are you?
I got fired.
And you?
Jacques...?
What's wrong?
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Well... here.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Who... Who is that?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Will he understand Spanish?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Esther!
So don't show a picture.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
What's wrong with him?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What should I charge?
So, how was I?
I wasn't too over the top?
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
I drink.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
I want him to lock me up.
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Show business?
More or less.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
What do you do now?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Go on foot.
What are you getting at?
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
No —— not yet.
I know. Funerals.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Disney! How inter...
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
What... What are you talking about?
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
B-Black...
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Good.
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
What if it is?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
It’s about the puppy. You got the money?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Où est passé ton salon?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Try again, and this time be polite.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Now?
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Yes...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
What did the king say?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But that was her order!
No...
I tried to.
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
The English??
In a village called Domremy.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
The voice was in your cell?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Buying her?
You think?
You will??
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
My captains have sworn their support.
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Is it long and hanging down?
That's not a lot.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Yes... they were.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
And... what does Jeanne think?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
No...
Stop it!  What are you doing?
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... what are you doing?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Why were you yelling like that?!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
Yes, my lord.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Then... why are you here so often?
I want to be with him always...
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
And how's Yurek?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who's recruiting?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
Yes, but what good did it do?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Pig!
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Where are we going?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
I don't know how to thank you.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Watch your feet!
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Like it were a piano?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
What's he say?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
Yes, why not.
You don't want to learn.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
We can't leave the piano
He's given it to us.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Which way are the rooms?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Then why ain't he dead?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
They're still looking for him.
Hackers.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.
Why?
Then you'll do it?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
Did he say he wouldn't?
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
You doin' anything tonight?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
He'll never do it.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Is that what it means?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
She's got me worrying, too.
Nothing.
Dorothy!
You're talking like a crazy person,
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You know, we know each other.
Yes.
tried him once -
Come on in.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
A new invention?
Yes.
That woman!
Gilbert!
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
Who's is it?
He telephoned me today.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
Chris!
We're just having a little drink.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
I can't! I haven't got it!
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
My wife.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
They'll want more than your word for that.
What am I?  The fall guy?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
She didn't tell me a thing.
I never saw that before.
You did.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
That's a fact.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Huh?
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Got a nice evening dress?
The suspects!  They won't come.
No, Mr. Charles.
You his wife?
Was he a good detective?
Home!
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Epps!
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Invest it.
Wh-what do you think--
They'll shoot us!
You can't tell anybody about this.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Think there might be more Iraqis?
Is it dead?
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
We should head Northeast.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
What do we do?
Shi'ites, I think.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Epps?
What?
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
A headache?
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
What is this?
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You get it yet?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
We...we could go home with something else.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
You have to go with us, Wes.
So?
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Now?
What time is it?
It's 3+27 hundred
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
How do you know?
You don't know that!
Remember this...?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
What?
Treat. We treat devices.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
I don't know. You tell me?
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
So cut both.
What?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Off the scale.
More metal... sharp edge...
What do you think?
Any word?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Alex-
What is that?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
What the hell was that?
Nothing so far.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
P.E.T.N ...
Sir...
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
It's our only option.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
And it had diamonds in the back.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Why should you?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Thank you.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
What?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Yes.
Yes.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
What?
Oh? 
This used to be my secretary's room.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Good night. 
Yes, I would!
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I <u>believe</u> you.
Instantly.
It could have been marvelous ...
But it could have been glorious.
What is it, madame?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
He started it.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
Something serious has happened.
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
How cold?
I know what ice fishing is!
Mr. Dawson, I --
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
You're right. Only you can do that.
This is horseshit.
It's so cold.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
How about a little game later?
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
How about giving me another coat?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Don't let's talk about it.
What, again?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Nix, the law!
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
No, sir?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Partners, ain't we?
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
I should say not.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Here you are, sir. 
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Next month is June.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Hello, Denby!
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Do what--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Come and get him.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
What's wrong, Doc?
Better.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
No really, I can stay a while.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Well how do we look?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Briefly.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
What about the uranium?
How is old Q?
Fishing?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Married?
Thanks.  Take care -
Boyfriend?
He was my father's best friend!
Down?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
... Yes???
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Damn. It's doing it again.
- I told you! He was there! -
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
What the hell is going on?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Your feet are cold.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
What, are you having another party?
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
I have someone I want you to meet.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
What's a toby?
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Wow!  Cool!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Toy?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
I could have stopped him.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't tell me what to do!
Come on, this way!
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hey, watch it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
You murdering dog!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Toss 'im overboard!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
Bad news?!
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
I like plaits.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Finn ...
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I'm Melanie.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
How much?
Why are you talking like that?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Oh, it is?
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
How long's the job?
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
What is this, like freebase?
Have you done your homework, honey?
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I feel good.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
Depends on the state.
You may speak.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, I've not brought them.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shag her senseless.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
What?
Thanks.
You're too young.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Sixteen next month.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Now remember --
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Running time?
Who wrote it?
The park?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking television.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Four Grand.
Your usual table, sir?
Stick it on my tab.
Yeah.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
That's fair enough.
Went ballistic?
What?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
The ship....
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Plotting our new course.
But the shuttle-
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
What do you know of my pain?
Where did you get this power?
The power was within you.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
Spock... don't.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
About the ship...


Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Sybok.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Did he say why?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
They'll start to soon enough.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Right on the money!
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
I... have come to communicate with my User.
What, just the three of us?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
How did you do that, Flynn?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Thank. you, Master Control.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
New guy...
You think we can make it there?
How?
Nice...
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What's the plan?
I still don't believe it.
Now what?
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
My husband is a good man.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
They said you had to run out.
What did you need?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Who's your little friend?
Like one?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I don't know.  I have to think...
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Gotten your mail yet?
The forager's back.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Is that your real name? Really?
Sure. Why not?
Would you like to get some pie?
You know when you sat behind me?
She OD'd, didn't she?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
That dazzling imagination.
Who and what is a Drexl?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Is this a joke?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
How come?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
You're really in love, aren't you?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Tell me.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
Really?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
The police department?
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
I really don't know.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Sure was.
You're no longer an extra -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Sorta room-mates?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Well?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
I need to go now.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
I need to go.
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
We need gas.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
What does this mean to you?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
They hurt you!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Hey, man...
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You really want to know?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
You can't do that yourself?
I said I was sorry.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
But, in particular?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
How much time?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, what is that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
What?
You know what I want.
You love him?
You just walk away.
From?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
What about him?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
But I want to say with you,
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You meant it.
That's a bit much.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
Drop it, Jake.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Not from where I stand.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Got any requests?
For what?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You're fucked.
Give it to me!
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Hell no!
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Christ, I don't believe this!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Who the hell are you?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Say, what happened to your hand?
California...
What can I do for you, lad?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Two-hundred dollars?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Will he be back soon?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
So?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No! Okay! Okay!
What you want?
I want my car.
No, I've got it.
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
My face tell you all that?
What?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
You love him?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
Nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Yeah.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Morning, officer.
Harlin's.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
I need a ticket.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Let me get your change.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
No baby, you got it wrong.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Oh.
How old is Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
He's asleep.
...I think rust.
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
I don't know Megan.
In college. A car accident.
I assumed because of the train.
What do you want?
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
Quick.
That's not what I witnessed David.
Are you finished?
I want to sleep here tonight.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one--
I'll help you.
How much did you take off?
Know what?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
We was... lyin'.
He said...
He give 'em names?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Books. He's my biographer.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Heard you done the roof yourself.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
He's... he's dead.
About what?
She's passed on, Kid.
Get some sleep, Kid.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You ain't shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Jesus.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
He's blind, for Chri...
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
We'll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Just like that?
Yeah?
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Goddamnit.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Fenster and Hockney?
The answer is no.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Waste of time.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Why didn't you say anything?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
But Keaton...
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
This is going to drive the ante up.
I was her doctor.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
Objection, we've...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
I . . ..
I...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You've just said you signed it.
She getting good care over there?
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
And you wrote that...
Why is that?
What is it?
That happens.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
What?
I object, your Honor...
Missus...
I'm a lawyer.
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Uh ...
...he's a good man...
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
What happened, Joey...?
...yeah...good...
What the hell are you doing here?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
In New York?
Hi.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Should I?
He won't talk.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Ernie's.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What do you want to know?
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No, you don't owe me anything.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Tomorrow night? Well --
I'll take care of you.
No.
No? Then what?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Why?!
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
No! Let me go!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I... didn't know where you lived.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Why?
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
No!... No!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
No, I can't tell you!
Home?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Go on.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Let me go! Let me go!!
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Would you please go and look?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
It wasn't your fault.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Do you know him well?
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Is she pretty?
Mm. Better.
Yeah.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She'll be out in a moment.
I said how's it going?
First of all...
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why was the floor wet?
Why?
What do you think you are doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
I'm calling the police.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Sun rises at 5:52.
Fuck you Boyd!
Later.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
I don't think so.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Don't sweet lip me.
She's in there!
Shut up.
Nobody knows she's here.
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Not true.
Then what do they have?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Not really, no.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
I think I forgot the tent.
Why what?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Charles Moore for instants.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
I've seen it on television.
Do you love me?
What kind of seats can we have?
I need your help.
That's sweet.
What are you doing?
Go have fun. Not too much.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
It's too late.
So what do we do?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Fucking desert.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
How long are you staying?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You have no feelings toward ...
And this innocent child.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
You must listen to me before you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
Is it all right?
Fifteen yards.
My God, what have you done to him!
Nothing.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
I'll be ready.
She's left.
Things seem to be getting better.
Are your parents alive?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Ask the priest, miss.
Have I slept long?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Think you can do it?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
He hears...everything.
How do you kill it?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
What's wrong with Parker?
Should I have?
SID —— NO!!!
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
Who said that?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
What are you saying...
It's the White House.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
...and...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.

You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
What rig?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
We're going to have to explain away the...
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
What is it?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
...the... 
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Why?
We'll be back tonight.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Anything at the Airport?
...uh huh...
How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...

I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do they go to War?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
The... 
...going to War...
...who is this guy...?
What?
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."

It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
I didn't ask for a dog.
A beret.
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
...gimme some help...
...mmm.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...if I had your looks, better.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
So you're hot on this stock?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
What makes you think you can?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Where is it?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
He still likes you
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
We're all here, and ready sir!
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
That's not what you said last night.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
No thank you sir we're fine.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
It's only two hours away.
What do you mean?
Do you really think so?
Fine.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
At the party.
Who's that?
Yes?
This fence...it's so...
No.  No, I don't.
You look a little old for a student.
I don't know.
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
Stop.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Absolutely.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
The planchette?
Nothing's happening.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Hartford?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I guess not.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
After that.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Our house.
Dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Norman...
I never said...
You know I am.
But I don't remember.
I don't like this, this...
So you fucked a student?!
Claire, please don't...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Huh.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Two what...?
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Eighty million doll --- ?
She didn't feel them
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I LOVE him!
I know that you're evil.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
What else did you see- Michael...?
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Hello...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
What about your work back home...?
Hi.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
When could I look round?
Yes it is...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
My names isn't ANGELA...
You don't know?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Tell me how it happened...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
It's been what, three years?
Just put it in my room
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
What is it now?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Get them together.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Ted! Do something!
Can you believe that was me?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
It's not up to me.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I didn't forget.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Eventually you'll let go.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's probably my office.
I'm trembling with excitement.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Tell me more.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
You promise you'll finish school?
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
You were the new and improved you.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Kelly.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
You okay?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Take your time.
I understand.
Did you try to fight him?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
We all have...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
If you want company...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
What about witnesses?
You didn't cuff her?
The teeth, were they...
I said he did.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You are.
I miss Dad.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Come on, let loose!
You, Kelly, Sam.
Davy.
And she wanted to talk.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
What?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
J. S. Bach.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Aha!
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
And people are actually fooled by that?
Not again.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Are those just button buttons or...?
What is this?  A whole new train?
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
French?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
He had a pressing engagement.
Well?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Willow Ufgood.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Because it's true.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Hey!  Give me that baby!
You?
She said lots of thing.s
She's in love.
Watch it!
I don't know, Willow.
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
She's hungry.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
We do not go into your courts.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
I can't.
Only the elders.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I'm coming.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
God, Fred...
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
No, you listen. Get out!
Dorothy!
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
If any!
Ohhh!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Toto's my dog.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Aw, come, come, come --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
...yes.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
Yes -- let's run!
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
...yes.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oil can what?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dorothy next!
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean she bit you?
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
We do.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Well, I --
But I still want one.
Stop that dog!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
What happened to Len Tashka?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
Makes her look even more innocent.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
...yes?...
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The inside man?
Who did you get it from?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
He was my father.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
One... last... screw?
You, of course. I need some information.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
A whore fucking.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
What -- am I --
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What if you¹re wrong??
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
. . . What?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
So do I.  So do you.
Where's Laurie?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Their real names, please.
I don't know their real names!
I'm terribly sorry.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Adrian.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
What do I get out of it?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Go to hell.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
What are you talking about?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
When can I see you again?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
You don't have to do that.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's the deal?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
That's the guy.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What does that mean?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
I wish I could go.
We all do.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Are you all right?
How long have you been in Alaska?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Were you now?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Where are we going?
He helped you?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
The way what is going to be?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
From your office, sir.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Is it that music?
Darling!
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Darling!?!
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Dr. Frankenstein?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
A piece of what?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
No, Fred ereck.
Why are you talking like that?
Aye-gor!
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Could be worse!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Yes, Master!
Where is he?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
May I see your violin?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Me?  Sing?
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
His schwanzstucker.
I'm getting tired.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
