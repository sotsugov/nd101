Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Forget it.
Where?
You're sweet.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Is he oily or dry?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Can we go now?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
So did you
You set me up.
Perm?
Daddy, no!
Just sent 'em through.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Thirty-two.
Who is she?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Your sister here?
How much?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
He always look so
William would never have gone to a state school.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Who?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I know a lot more than that
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Why, don't you?
Then why'd you ask?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
BIANCA
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Look up, sunshine
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Maybe.
Something like that
No, I won't go with you
It's just something I had.  You know
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
What?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I didn't care about the money.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
No?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Damn God!
How long?
We don't need to know.
God be with us admiral.
And what do you think Mendez?
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here.  I have your money.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
They won't until this is over.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
I'll make some for us.
Daphne, I...
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Who says she's a suspect?
You got any better ideas?
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
I'm not.
You're ruthless.
Well, that's great.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Not what.  Who.
Okay.  You ready?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Cut!
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Yes, the money is good.
What are you doing here?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I'm here for movies.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
But you knew that, right?
He knew all along.
What??
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
The clerk?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Right. Just a sec.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
How?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Are you reasonably awake?
Two more.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
And don't you worry about it.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
That's true
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Great, just great.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here's hoping, baby...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Yeah, I read the report...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
I'll keep it in mind.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Hi, it's me...
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
This ain't a credit business.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Good luck..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Like shit.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
...'Scuse me?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
It's like a cab isn't it?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I thought you were divorced.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
I know.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Nobody knows anything.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
I know what you did.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Fuck you!
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Shut up.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Three, four years.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
How much?
See ya.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
Okay.
You told me to look, so I looked.
How will I get it to you?
Yes, but...
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
Why do you think he did it?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Yes.
It's been six years.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
I'll do what I can.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
"In her dream"?
Three days.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Earth to Alice...
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Alice...
I've got to go.
But Dad --
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's their problem.
But I've seen her grave.
Who?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
So?
What about down?
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What?
- for horrors like yourself?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Yeah. I know about that.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I hear Twombley got shot.
That was me.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Wonderful!
Yeah?
Hmm.
This way.
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Yeah.
Sure you did.
I just think you used to be bad.
It's not that.
No.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Something bugging you?
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You? Why?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Then... I guess you have to.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
How?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
You're not using it today?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Sleeping.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Who?
No shit.
Who?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Money.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Been better, Dad... You?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Any of us?
Where are we now?
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Over my dead body.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Yes, sir.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Flying the plane.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
That was very well put, Ted.
Now!
Roger.
Simon, what are you saying?!
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
All right.  Here.
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
A b...
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I love you.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Uh-huh.
Who wants to be first?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Thank you.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
And that fits?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Stay back!  I'm okay.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Was.  Divorced.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
To the... to the beach?
Nothing.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Yeah.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Yes.  That follows.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Why not?
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
I don't know.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Yes, Hicks?
Sure, Hicks.
Do it!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Anytime.  Anywhere.
You're really something, ace.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sure.  Go left.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
That's right.
What are you talking about. What people?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
In a harem.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
What?
Where?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go!
Yes!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Your father is dead.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I can't write it!
Madame. How can I help you?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Then he didn't send you?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Originals?
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Be careful!
Behold!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Ah-ha!
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Why not?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
This is just a game, Papa.
Papa!
No one calls you that.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
That's right.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Madame.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Really?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
But what is it they don't like?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How much?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Are you ill?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes!
I'm not leaving you.
What for?
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
I think you'd better.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
No, but I'm the best.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I do not seek forgiveness.
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Ah.
I can't wait.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Who is she?
Yes, I am looking after him.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
What did he say?
Yes.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, I should think so.
I expect you shortly.
Aw come on, Alex!
Will you give me a break?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
My best friend. My very best friend.
What?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
A werewolf?
I was dreaming again?
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
I wasn't hallucinating.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I'm freezing.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No.
Right.
No!
Oh, come on, tell us.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Yes.
Good.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Yeah.
It's circling us.
Are you going to help me up?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
What?!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Yes.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You look awful.
How shall I do it?
Send them in.
Oh.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
But listen, Tom, I—
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yes - sure—
About twenty-four thousand.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh!
All right, Jack, all right.
We can take blood from anything —  If it's comin' to us.
Why not?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Well, you can. You always could.
What is?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No.
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
What are you doing here?
Yes, now.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Thank you!
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Yes, sir.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Hello, Helen.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Well, I—
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
But I haven't . . .
Come here, honey!
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
I tell you, I saw them!
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
What time did you get in?
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Hey!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
I got three.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
I'm out.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Sadie was not a man!
They're just insurance in case we run.
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
You're right, sir.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
That would have made an impression.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Maybe, maybe...
You are a charmer.
Don't care.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Bob's upset.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Not if I find the right girl.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Little ones.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I think so.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Don't talk about it much, though.
Move you fools!
Good.
What is that?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin?
Eight?
Yes, dear.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
We never really shared one.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
It's just not.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Just...say...no.
Yes, sir.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Can you bring Mr...
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Just...say...no!
No. Flattering, but no.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Had his apartment been burglarized?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
What am I gonna do?
Speak up. Come on.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Yes, Owen?
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
I can paint anywhere.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
They hack into people's programs?
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Yes sir.
Outpost doesn't own em.
We could move 'em up here.
Oh. No thanks.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
...Worse?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Why's that?
Then and now.  But not right now.
But why would they --?
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
You mean -- break in?
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
I met this girl.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thanks.
Oh, and Austin...
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
There's one more thing, Austin.
What's the other?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Why not? It's a question.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
He's too well-protected right now.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Yeah. What?
In due time.
I don't want to.
Blow me.
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Did you ever want to?
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
There are limits?
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You mean you don't recall??
Sir August...?  What now?
Hmmm ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
To find out who killed my husband.
Next assignment?
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
1922. Why the kippers?
Much better.
Mother?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Did he say who?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Because you always obey orders ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
You're playing games.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Have you any place in mind?
Pity your mother came, too ...
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Peter's brother?  But --
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
How did you guess?
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
I feel sure of it.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
I want Debbie.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes I did.
Thank you, sir.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I can't sleep.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Why don't you get undressed.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
You're on.
You're so romantic...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Great, Mom.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
I didn't know you were into that.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Right.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
I'd love that.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You can tell a man by his friends.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Debbie.
What's with her costume?
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
It's comin' along... want a beer?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
-- What were they doing there?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Really? No kidding.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
I want another shot, Sir.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
He just wants to --
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He treats you okay?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Putty? On both doors?
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
And the world -- the whole world.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Those fucking Mob assholes.
"The Strawberries"?
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Let me think about it.
Yeah. I'm sure.
This psycho can.
Who are you revolting against?
Delacroix.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
That's mighty black of you.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Look at my lips.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
How much?
Different.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
To what?
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm telling you it's not.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
I don't know about that plantation angle.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
I didn't mean that, in life.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Hello.
We both lied to him.
A gift.
For what?
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Work related or otherwise?
He, I'm Mona.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
I feel fine.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I'll be right over.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Oh her.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
A song a comin' I feel.
What?
You look beautiful like that.
And?
I know I won't be your puppet.
Where are you bound for?
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Neither!
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Yes, sir.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
I believe they will deport you.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Have you had one?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not one.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
It is my only object.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
As much as possible.
Yes!
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
What do we do?
Fine.
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Yeah.
How do you know that?
Yeah...
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Just look. Little pocket.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
No. Poetic justice, though.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
And the problem is you only got three.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Got it.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Buttfucks the cabin?
You wanted to get the truth.
No death certificates. No crime.
What if I don't want it?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Want company?
I should probably write that down.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
He wanted more than that.
We've been making progress, I see.
You can't threaten me --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Why?
Let's see it.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Really?
What's your name, Giant?
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
You owe me three-fifty.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Yes.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
How what happens?
How I go.
Story of my life.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
How did you get so many?
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I'm robbing this place.
Hello.
Because he's dying.
I need to lie down for a bit.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Yes. Thank you.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Such as?
Do you want to stop?
That's not a burn.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
What are you doing here?
Ch...
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Right.
Right.
I...
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
They go.
You don't understand anything.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Have you got your passport?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
But, you know, so what?
He will come back.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
You don't understand you either.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Have you had any before?
Are you scared?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
That'd be nice.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
She's around. Always is.
You been home yet?
You go to hell.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Let go...
You sayin' you'll do what?
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Come on, gal...
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Why you got me chained?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Uh-uh.
To freedom.
You can handle it.
Looks like you know a song.
Maybe I won't.
This Rae... you get with her?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What'chu sayin'?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
This all looks wonderful.
Ask the chef.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Why she got a chain on her?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Rae!
Yeah?
Are you wasted?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
Hey, when in Rome --
You said that in the last two places.
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
If you give me one.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
San is an honorable title.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
I can't...
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
A wife.  She left.
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
The cheese...
I'd like that.
Then take it from him.
What?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
It is not allowed.
Look.
He'll be dealt with.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
Death.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
I am?
You're just all so... so different.
Of course not.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Thank you.
He's not ready yet.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Garbage man?
Okay, but...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Vodka!
No thanks.
I gotta piss.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Meaning?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
I don't know nothing about it.
Sorry.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Me and my dad.
Dead.
Not too good.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Sitting next to you.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
A tortoise.  What's that?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
What about friends?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's your problem?
Yes?
Really?
Sure.
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Thank-Q!
How long would you need me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
A wife?
They're all divorced?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
I was wrong!!
Yes!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Uh...yeah.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yes!
I like her.
No way.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Goodnight!
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
How do I leave here?
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
I promise. Is that all?
I'll try.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Not particularly.
I don't think so.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Goodnight.
I don't see anything!
How do you do, ma'am.
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
I never know anymore.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Yes...
I want him to at least see the sky!
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I knew you'd like him.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Uh..he might of.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Fallout shelter.
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Where?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Stand by. One.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Who knows you have these?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Jeffrey nothing.
Nobody.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Yes.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
No, please. I won't.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I think I better go.
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Oh he forced you, huh?
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Okay Frank.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Alright.
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
What else is new? Right?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright.
Yes. I do.
Brilliant.
Yeah.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Oh yeah?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Got it.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What?
What are you saying?
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
...so that which is good may flourish
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
And he is one smart man.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Rocco!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Really want to know?
The what man?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Shit! Shit!
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
You sure you killed them?
What the fuck do you mean?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
I believe these young men are right.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
How long since your last confession, my son?
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
This is he?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, I heard that.
Nothing. Go ahead.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Look at the treads on those.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Sure.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No kidding.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Where was it parked?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
She doesn't need to know.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
That's what she is!
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
As a person?
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Nobody move!
Careful. Check his pulse.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Yeah.
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure.
How big is it?
He stole a tractor.
What?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Yeah. He said that.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
Like silk?
Uh-uh.
Is that Buckethead?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
So who's going to know?
You're paranoid, Bob.
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
This is natural.
Did we get it?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I don't know.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Let's go.
Come on in. What you been up to?
I never agreed to that.
Bullshit.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Take him to the car, Bob.
He's stuck between two floors.
Here we go.
Now!
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
He's damn good.
Can't get it. It won't... 
You got that?
Is that your chiquita?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
She is a good looking woman.
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Right.
What?
Nice to meet you.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
What?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Keep going...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Conklin.
He's dead.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- my coat -- but we should --
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
There's no choice.
Who is Pamela Landy?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Your first assignment was Geneva.
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Still...
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Amnesia?
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
We must sue for peace.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
You mock us with a smile?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Hamish, I... thank...
Your rest is making me exhausted.
That's just a dream, William!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I could crush you like a roach.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
You are. And I'll come again.
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
...Tonight!
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Anything.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Weirder than this?
It's coming... argh! I can't!
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Hi, Lenny.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
...yes.
Been there, done that.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Yes, something.
What are they?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Oh, darling!
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't think I will, Rick.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
No.
And I said I would never leave you.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Rick? Who's he?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
You're saying this only to make me go.
What for?
Right.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
I believe you have a message for him?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
What else, my dear Major?
How about New York?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
There seems to be no secret about that.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
-- You thought what?
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
No.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Do too much, I'll die.
Take it.
No.
I'm putting it off.
Why do they have to die for me?
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Let's take a look.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
He's your cute thing.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I would have done the same thing.
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Great.  Really.
It means a lot...that you came.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
I'm touched.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
You're fucking dead!
To life.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
I understand.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
But did you know him?
A B-24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
You do it then.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
No trouble.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
That's it.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Sorry, Homer...
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
I don't follow.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
That's not a bad place to start.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Like what?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
And what about Big Al?
Two million.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
And some new clothes.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Your mess.
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Good point.
We never had a problem with that before.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Confidence. It's just confidence.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
I'm down!
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
She.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Why not?
I hope it brings you luck.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Leave me alone, Marion.
No.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Yes, I know that.
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
The debts.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
Just an accident. Nothing.
You don't like cheats, do you.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Then you're not a pro.
The point is, they want a man inside.
Wait a minute...
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Ross.
Who did it? Tell me!
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I might.
Thanks.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
That bitch? No.
It was you, you shit.
We check every four days.
Good call.
What for?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
In a second.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Wha?
-- automatic channels open --
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Bruno's girlfriend.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
I'm on a break.
Leave.  Now.
You're not still pissed?
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Can you help me get her back?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Lauren's not my wife.
I won't be staying.
How do I know you didn't?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
The other ones?
You did go through my stuff.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You don't want to.
Oh?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I think you should go now.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
How's this about me?
You're crazy.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You know what I'm saying.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
And why should she?
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
She was the one--
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Thanks.
It's okay.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Curly.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Check.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Go ahead, Jam.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Was it a teddy?
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Look, you can have my wallet...
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah.
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Take it off. I want to see you.
Wonder where we'll be then.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
But you're OK?
Why? Is this about the book?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Know what?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel alone right now?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Everything is going to be just fine.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You can suck a fuck.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank God for bunge cords.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
C'mere. I love you so much.
You heard me. Where is it?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
And the bite marks on my ears?
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
I know.
Hi.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
Yeah.
Dakota.
Tammy Curry?
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Uh, Gladys?
Enid ate a whole pan!
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
And wear a crown and everything.
The king can do no wrong! 
The king can do to wrong! 
Who to?
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Yes, sir. 
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
All right -
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You told it to me.
That's not bad for any day.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
You worm!
You upstart!
THEN IT'S WAR!
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
Your Excellency!
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Did you see it?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
What do you mean?
He fell.  He falls.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Everything will be seen to.
Never mind that, I want my man!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Indeed!
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
Are you comfortable here?
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Want to come out?
No, nothing.
Yes.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yyyess.
Say "Merrick".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Yes! The workhouse!
No, he's very upset about something.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
A dressing bag.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
You're losing your temper!
It's your fantasy...
I said welcome.
Those things in your hands.
But surely you know...?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
What was she like?
I've never LOVED anybody!
Who?
Why?
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
Do you believe I love you?
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
What d'you mean?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
He wants to kill US!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Odin!
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
DEATH!
Bye... sorry...
You will wait?
Please.
No, I'm not.
Got you!
Oh...
YOU do it!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Help!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
You liar!
And something to sharpen them with?
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember.
In the world.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I don't really know how --
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I'm Joel.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
What?
Very much.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
I know a man who needs a refill.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Okay.
Yeah? Oh, great!
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
Okay.
It's three.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
What?
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I love it!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Egad, were you horrified?
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
And I didn't have an argument.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
yeah?
I love her.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Your dried cum.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
It's too late.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I better do this, Stan.
It's a good one all right.
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Nothing.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
How do you mean?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
He went home sick.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
That's your problem.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
What is Debbie's position?
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Well.... er...
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
So now you're bummin' around?
A born freak can only go uphill.
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
What?
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
It is not.
His peritoneum has ruptured...
What's on your mind?
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
What you got, Peters?
Frozen.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
I don't know...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
What are you talking about?
You're lying...!
One-four degrees...
Love to.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Carbon dioxide?
What's causing the readings?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I know that.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They're explosive charges.
Can you see a body?
Keep him talking.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Do they have pressure?
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Yes.
It means nothing.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
He's made a few changes.
Got it, teach.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Go back to the drawing board.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
They're not costumes.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
What? What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
Excuse me?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
All right!!
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Later.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Nice to meet you.
Get a ride with somebody.
You first.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Really?
I'm really pretty busy...
Fine. Get lost.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
My brother is gonna shit.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
So what did you do?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Not since November.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Climax together.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I couldn't make it in time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
You're gonna flunk me?!
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you want to come inside?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Oh. I see.
I'd like that.
Anything to drink?
Not for me.
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Naw!
Really?
Hell, no!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Where'd you get this?
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Do you think you can handle it?
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Never missed a plane yet.
No! I swear I'm not!
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
You and a lot of other people.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Her fella.
Easy.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Just move!
Fuck you too.
What?
Your brother, huh?
Will I go crazy or something?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
How much you got?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
Whoa!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
No bullshit.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Amazing you made it this far.
Am I too heavy for you?
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Oh...
I think --
Are you lying to me?
I'm not lying.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
Thank you --
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Who?
Without me.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
...I see.
Thank you.
See you next weekend, Dad.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
I know that, Dad, but --
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
Address?
Occupation?
You can always come see it in London.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
What about your husband?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah, well --
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
You think I'd miss it?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Yeah.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
What for?
And?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You give up on her?
I got your number, Mister Man.
Oh Harry...
Yeah. I don't know.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
How did I look?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Who're you?
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
I'll be back.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke!
Oh for Christ's...
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
No! No!
You drove him to his torment.
The music? Or the fire?
Why?
There, there... shhh...
I should go. I should leave today.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
I wish to be your wife.
Your decision. For us.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
Aye, Captain.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
They'll hang him all the same.
I resent God's monopoly.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Why?
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
The strain was evident.
I guess...
Good night, Brenda.
Sure.
I finished the boats.
Un-hunh.
I'll go take a look.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
Where's Ned?
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
You? The brick?
There you are dead wrong.
Why not?
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Yeah.
I'm exhausted.
He's running the show.
Jacob.
In heaven.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Yes.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
To yours.
In the Winnebago.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Everybody goes home!
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Whatsamatter?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
One... Two... Three.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
What'd ya see?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Keep your voice down.
I did?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What do you mean?
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Of course, but there's more --
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Did you hear?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You'll think about my offer?
No, ma'am.
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Get it up!
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
What?
Yeah.  Me too.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Not me.  You?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Sure, sure.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Should I be afraid?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
I'm so glad we agree.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
You never said it was off the record.
Five bucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
It's your choice.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
Well, I think you're cute.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Sounds like a big company.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Good idea.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Open.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Like YOU know?
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
I had the shot...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
Shut up.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
All systems are working, Commander.
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
It's ... incredible.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
But I'm the Commander!
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Let me think. I need time to think.
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
What the hell are you talking about?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Mark 12.
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Simpler.
Home.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
But...Why?
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
You go too far, Benedict.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Delighted, sir.
We better, Congress invented him.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
No one knows...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
But it's more than just that, am I right?
Gag on your own invention, then.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
George!  So good to be back!
They help me understand why we fight.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
Get these men back in line!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
To win this war I need an army.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
I don't want to see your hospital.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
It's the freest land on earth.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
You're out of your mind!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
So... how many movies you been in?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
What about her?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Get in line, bro.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Ever shot anybody.
Harry, look at me.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
I found him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One we're producing.
Martin, look at me.
How do I know that?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Man, can you scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
What do you think?
Not yet.
Depends, who pays?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You're as bad as Harry...
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Hm?
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
Murray's dead.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
And after all, you have such morals.
A passenger liner. Over.
Sixty pounds.
Damn mind of it's own.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Threw a turbine blade.
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
She take a radio?
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Could be meant as a warning.
How do you mean?
What do you propose?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
There's a charming thought.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Yeah. Thanks.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Are you sure?
Greer?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
But, who -- ?
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Couldn't sleep.
Not our mystery guest again.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
What's that supposed to mean?
Right here.
What?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
We could call for help.
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
No, no. You got leak.
Fifteen, at the most.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Maxine.
What?
Are you going to yell at me?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
So what do you think?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Yeah, well... hi...
Why?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Just look at them!
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Oh, we totally have to.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
What a little hosebag.
Bingo!
Come on, it's too late now...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Not really...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It's always closed...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You're gross.  See that guy?
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
God, you're really obsessed...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
I don't believe you.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Great...
It's fine.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
How much is this?
Who does?
Five hundred.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Okay.
NO!!!
Oh, right...
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Jesus, Seymour.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
It's not hopeless...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
For nineteen years...
Are you okay?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
How can you be so sure?
Really?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
I-I-I...
Yeah, well... me neither...
No problem.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Yeah.
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
How; we don't know where they are?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
You never had it.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
What?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What happened to them?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
I do, actually; very much.
Since his beard was red.
Four should do it.
Hold your son high. 
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
-- the sorrow --
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Hello, Venkman.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Wonder what?
What's the matter, dear?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Eight o'clock?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I want to help you.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
You could say that.
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
Why do you want to see it?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Wow!
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Why not?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Who?
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What do I say?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Not yet, dear brother...
Gladly Caesar.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
He left us at dawn.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
I've read of it.
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
They can't... if this is Rome...
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
My troops don't make policy.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
You get to come alive again in the country!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Yes.
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I don't know.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
All right.
Yes.
With a family?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Get out of here.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Did you say rape her?
Let me go.
Then what?
Don't you have it on?
But Elaine --
But you might.
Why do you have to see him?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
No, sir.
You heard me. Out of here.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
It's in the main ballroom.
Of course.
What?
What for?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Sit down.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
But they would! Don't you see?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Waiter!
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
What?
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
You what?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Go ahead then.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
I don't remember.
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
You walk right out the door.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
But you don't hate him.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
How do you think.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
There's nothing to tell.
But why shouldn't I?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Go home now.
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Very good, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
No wait. Wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
No.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
It's Benjamin.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
I don't believe it.
Time's getting short.
Why?
With the pearls --
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
All right. We'll dance.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone --
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I know.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I --
Why later?
Bless you --
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Good!
You've lost everything?
Well -- last night was not so good.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
And the child isn't coming?
I don't know.
Send his bags up to my room.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Oh -- you would!
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
You think so?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Yes --
Yes --
We did not approach you.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
I wish to be alone.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
What is this insolence?
Go away -- go away.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
You are late. Hurry.
Good night.
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Pretty as a picture.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
You expect me to buy this?
You're a thousand percent right!
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Hah.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
I certainly hope not.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Why? What's wrong?
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Lead on.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Oh, come on, Roy.
Perk, remember?
I guess I owe you my life.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I'll get it.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Joe, you know you'll --
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
Myra, I'm not following this.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Yeah? How?
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
You're so predictable.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I can't afford to get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
Yeah.
Who?!
Michael Meyers!
Looks great.  It does.
It's always John.
Never.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Is Tim there?
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Jamie's baby ...
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Didn't recognize you.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Um.
Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
I'm liable to find anything!
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Me?
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
I wanted to apologize.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
What?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
What's good about that?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Sir?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
Heaven.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Daughter--I love you very much.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Your old beau?
We all are.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Nothing would please me more.
I have a brain.
Which one?
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Yes.
I see.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
If he thinks he's man enough.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Oh dear.
I've got to run!
I came back.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
We have, have we?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
You were wrong, you quack!
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
I'm high as a kite.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
My violin is avenged!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
I've enjoyed being man.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Kid--kid--
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I didn't know that.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What?
He can hardly talk.
Okay.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I see.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Take plenty of cigars.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
Tonight's the night.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
They didn't murder me.
I believe in miracles now.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Yes, we do.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
No, just not the type.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Yeah.
You don't drink?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
How important do you think sex is?
Tijuana.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
I can stop if you want.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You wife isn't dead is she?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Andy.
And better?
I've got a meeting...
No.
They're legal now.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Yeah, sure.
I just heard. Who is he?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Just leave me alone.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What?
That's not true, Mr...?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Good.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Com'on, tell me.
Huh?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Wait here.
I'm a file clerk.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you see?
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
No.  I thought not.
Yearse!
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Yes. Very much.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Well, I really don't drink...
I don't know.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
"And this too shall pass away."
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
No. Like this.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Your classmates?
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
War is not all black.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
I knew you'd come.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
No. You look...
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
It's been Hell.
You were ALL human!
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
You mean, outside... with her.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Got tired of me?
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Who?!
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Each of us gets a belt.
-- should go back. Now!
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Well good n-
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
I like that...
I know.
That you feel that way about me.
Pardon?
You did this before, right?
I have to speak to my father.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.  Oh yes.
I don't want to see the dress.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Ssh!
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Hell...
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Yes. They'll never find us.
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
This afternoon.
Oh my God.
Just a thought --
Ah!
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
No argument.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Kirsty.
Just soda.
Please.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Am I?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Is Julia here?
Kitchen's through on your left.
No you don't.
So lie down.
If there's a train.
Your father told me you were working here.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
We can take your car.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
None.  Christ!
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Fuck off, Barry.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Yes way.  It's really...
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
We work there!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Hi.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I think you know that.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Just ask it!
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You're also an idiot.
What?
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Okay.
How?  How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Wanna go to dinner?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Good.
Thank you.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Yes.  You?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Yeah.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
But you must have --
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
No, we...
Yeah.
Sure.
This one came unassembled.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
I've been to Church Hill.
Have you gone to the police?
You are being foolish.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
That would be difficult to explain.
I haven't killed _you_.
All of it finished.
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
Not power.  Not control.
What do you want from me?
What are you getting at, Moran?
What's all of this got to do with me?
Never take up poker, Detective.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You are the same?
Does it change with me in the room?
No!
It is the truth.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
But we cannot be killed.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Again.  Try again.
Go to hell.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
Of course.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Do you have cause to bothering us?
It's all we have.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
If you wish to play games, Major.
It never changes, Major.
Yes, he was.
I don't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Head still secure to the neck.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
You're insane.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
I've had a few more concerns.
It's all we have.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
He's mistaken.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Oh yes, more than enough.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
What's the idea of locking this?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Bon jour!
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where'd she go?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Then who are you?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
You bet I've got a better offer.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Now you got me.
What do you mean?
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
You grey-haired old Judas!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
All right -- all right!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Not this gun!
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
An attempt to ruin us!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
All right, Judge.
Give me that!
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Come on with that money!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
What do you mean?
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
What's from the Governor?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
She and Mollie were talking.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Apparently so.
Would.
It's easy. I've done it.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, for the baby, really.
Wow!
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Kiss me Hardy.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
I will if you will!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
They'd gone.
What's that?
Oh, that.
You taste it.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Grace!
You might still have a house.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Father, that's enough now
Cool.
Baby! Stop!
You're welcome.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
You shouldn't a done that.
The Duke?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Hell yeah.
I don't know.
What's that?
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Thanks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Drive through it!
Is that all... think real hard.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
You find something, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
Oh, right.
I don't doubt that.
Firefly.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
That is the wrong fork, young man.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Oui, doctor, oui.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Not at all.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Gabby, what is it?
Very well.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What?
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
No.
I want to be the way I was before.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Yeah?
Oh?
Please, honey, let me in.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
You do?
You do?
Why certainly!
I love you so much.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
All right.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Do you like my new look?
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
How come?
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shit.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Lila?
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
I have to talk. Is that okay?
No.
You want a chaser?
No.
It's open...  What'll you have?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Cash.
Twelve thousand.
Thought you only drank milk.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
You know everybody, don't you?
Sign up.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Where?
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Half.
Well, here it's half.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Get with what?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
A son.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Thanks. I will.
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No. I'll take you home.
Thanks.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean?
Me. It's Eddie.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
That's right.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
You watch me.
You name it.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
My wife.
You want to kill them.
I don't know.
Yes.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I surrender --
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
What did it look like?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Sure ... fine.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Why, yes.  Why?
May I ask why?
About what?
Mr. Gardner, I --
Of course.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Hide the car.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
Oh?
It's really nice of you to help us.
Cool.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
A toast to the end of the world.
Better be. You left me for him.
You bet it did.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
More than likely.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
What happened?
A countdown to what?
Dad, don't start.
You still got the Olds?
Can't this thing go any faster?
Dad...
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
Spunky?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
It's doing what?
What?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Dick-weed!
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't even see them fire!
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
And before here?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Yes. My treat.
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Yes. Now we know.
What?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Tapestries?
How dare he?!
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
We're through!
I knew it was you --
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Don't worry. He won't.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
And do I detect a rebuke?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
You call this archaeology?
Junior...
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
A long time to wait.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
There are no stories anymore.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
What?!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
A what?!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
Who's you?
Who?
Your name is Al...
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Then how'd I get here?
Are you crazy?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
I'll talk to them.
I'll tell you what to say.
This is a Fiesta!
Yeah...Who is?
Just walk down the hall?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
What about it?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Are you screwing with any nerves?
You're out of shape.
How should I know?
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Voice stress analyzer.
You're doing great with her.
What is it?
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
Is that all?
It wasn't like that.
Follow her.
Where are you going?
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I was afraid of that.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
What exactly?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Gimme a minute.
Yeah, sure.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Let us get to the border!
What a nerve!
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
We insist.
What?
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
We're here.
Oh.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
A little voice in my head.
Sir?
Dinner...tonight.
Me still. They left you alone?
...I...don't know.
It's not apparent.
As if your mind's not all there.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Get your things.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
You coming along?
This going to work?
They asked about you.
Escape.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It'l be alright.
No?
So we better get started.
You got a deal. 
P.J.'s.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Then what are you going to do?
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
No, I'm not...
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Come again?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Where should I wash them?
Hello? Yeah...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Oh, baby...
Who is this?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Lowell.
Lowell!
Give me a break!
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Everything interests me.
How much would I get paid?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
You charge by the hour?
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
ABC...?
She's okay.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
You're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Object!
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
He --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Howard!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
I had no idea until after, but --
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Here's her picture...
Who's the pigeon?
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Set one side for Bel Air.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
He's the wrong man.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
What do you mean, was.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Ruth Rabino.
It's about time.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
Gotcha.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Marylin! Listen to me.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
She held that against you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Huh?
Yes.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
It's okay Joe.
Forgery? Fraud?
I thought so.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Jesus.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Ha Ha.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
And she has...?
HA!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She owes me a meal.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
And only two are hers.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Come in. Sit down.
Yes, I know—but—
I might.
You ought to know why. Because—
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
No.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
No, I'll go through with it.
Is that his name?
Are you going to see him?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
I don't want it reported!
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Beat it! 
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Your ego is colossal.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Yeah?
What are you talking about?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Yeah.
I'm following you.
That's silly.
You're prejudiced.
know—but—
But what!
was so scared—that it scared—
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Mind your own business.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come on! come on! 
Darling!
What about money?
Yeah, swell.
You bet I did.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Whatever you say, darling.
But can't you wait until morning—
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I am, Joe.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Hey, you!
There's a seat over there for you.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
And Oswald?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
What did they...
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
And then Sunday?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
I want the truth.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
...you heard echoes.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
I wouldn't imagine where.
A Perry Russo?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
No.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
No, it can't!
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Ever ask him?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
You have other information?
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
And what would I have to do?
Yes?
Not a problem.
Thanks.
Who?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Course you didn't.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Hey, Jackie.
She almost sounds scared.
Arrest me.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
What's your brand?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
The Delfonics.
How'd you feel about it?
Bigger?
They seem to like the idea.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Do you think they bought it?
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Uh-huh.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
We're partners.
Spain.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
How can you help us?
Not really.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
What did you do after that?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Sure.
They asked.
I knew it.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
I understand woman, damn!
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Uh-huh.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Two months shy of four years.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
I dunno.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm in my underwear.
Sure.
What's your relationship?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's right.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Yeah.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Did the police contact you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She was afraid.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
You expect me to just walk in there?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She's all alone.
Turn left.
No.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
He's around.
Hello, Sam.
I'm okay.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Just my luck.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
There's nothing to expose.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
It was the window.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I can't relax.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Whataya mean, no record?
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Save me!
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Thanks.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Lemme see.
I just want to look ...
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
We're at Della's.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
The numbers stop at 107.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
He said you didn't have one.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Stick with me, kid.
Bullshit!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Then don't bug me.
Goddamn you!
Long time ago.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
If you're lucky.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
I'm awake?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know. I don't know.
You come home with me.
Died?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Bring it in.
He doesn't like it.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
I don't know. Nothing.
Done?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
He....He...
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
We could convert fission transistors.
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
I know you.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Would you?
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Am I in there?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
I missed you too.
Keep trying!
Thirty seconds.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
But...I...400 years?
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
No!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
I never hear the whistle.
What'll I tell the kids?
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Rogue?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
This is quite a place.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What else could've done that?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Fasten the pole.
The shaft is giving.
I don't think so.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'm supposed to be running.
Whose idea was it?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Is that normal?
What?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Can we make out now?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What is your job title, exactly?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Yeah.
When was this, like '96?
Oh.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Yeah?
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Why? What the big deal?
Why?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Room with a toilet, got it.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
They're yellow.
Can you see it?
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Could I try that?
Hold still.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Early! Stop!!
Walter Livesy.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
How much do I owe you?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
The party?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
No, never. Excuse me.
...Janitor's job.
His Parole Officer.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
To what? Virgins?
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
You think he's got any herb?
You down with the boost?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Darcy?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Bet.
That.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.
I had a female vagina last night.
Yeah. Do it again.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hold on.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
What?
I tested positive?
But I only had sex with Telly.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Yeah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Yeah.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Oh god. That's horrible.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You are!  I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
I'm positive.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
He was with me?
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
Not really.
Just like who?
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
The police haven't told you?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
What scars?
Fuck off!
My cheering section.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Yeah.
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
It's important.
And this Jeremy--
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Ten days ago.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
What are they, please?
It's alright.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
You.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
It wasn't intentional.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
No.
No.  You were talking about chess.
What do you want on it?
Can I come in?
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
He didn't tell you either.
Of course not.
I'm sure you are.
That's worse.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn.
I know it.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Hand over your dinner.
Would you settle for a boar?
Can't I come, too?
No.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
No.
You had better manners as a pig.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Yes.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Many have perished in that maze.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
You had a son.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Yes.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Good.
What, for example?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
...OK.  I love you anyway.
What shall we do?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...One second.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh? That's smart!
Huh? Why?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Then...
Where?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
I won't let you die.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
How long does this... Mania last?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You do?
Twenty miles?  I see.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
You like to take walks?
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Most certainly.
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Maybe.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Walking where?
It's mine to risk.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What?  Who are you?
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
No.
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Hello.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
You what?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
Very clever.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
What do you mean?
Me neither.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
OK.
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Well... OK...
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
With an old friend.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Are we done for today?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Who could better understand than me?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Really? Thanks.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Thank you. I love you, too.
No way --
I will...
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Did she do that to you, too?
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
But maybe it is --
No, she can't move for an hour.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
So Friday at eight?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
Of course.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
No, silly. I go here.
Harvard. Law school.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Faith.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
Like some vile toadstool.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
And if I cannot?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Nay.  This time we strike first!
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
The chill is worse this night.
There must be some way to get it up there.
It doesn't matter.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll try.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Liar!
What's the matter?
I'll go search for it.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Ask away, sweet man.
Exceeding fair.
She's dead!
No fear of that now.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
That very nice.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I wanna be with you today.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Who are you?
Here, honey!
Nope.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I might not stay, anyway.
No.  That's okay.
Why are you so stupid?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What are you talking about?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
If that's what it takes.
It's thirty feet.
What are you on?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
He buys and sells the world.
That's too long.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Not a shower.
You're here early today.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I did warn you.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
To check up on me?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
You'll have money when you work.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I might have a solution.
I know.  Why?
What do you know about me?
What would you be doing now?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
Are you taking them still?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd build a house.
I haven't been touched in years.
I know there's an explanation.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, I think.
He doesn't answer.
Kurt's been feeding him.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I'm married.
The first and the last.
Sam's favorite.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
You're not well.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
This was my very first slow dance.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
If I weren't married?
I need to know.
Does Alyssa know?
I'll make you something.
I'd be you.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I know.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
I just thought it would be nice.
No, nigger.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Sharp.
Why not?
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Sure, boss.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
I don't think so.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
So?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
So?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Let me take a look at that map.
I'm stuck!
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Him?
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
You killed Santa Claus?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Just like Elvis.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Don't do it!
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
You did it for Namath.
Yes, Jimmy.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Son, just do your best.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Coulda been much worse.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I know, your wickedness.
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
You're not saying it's up to me?
By she, do you mean he?
Yeah. You do it.
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
So I followed him...
Andrew.
You think I'm a tourist?
Really?
You have a dog? What kind?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
My perfume?
Good. I was concerned.
What?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
No.
I think I'm floating.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
East Rutherford.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
No.
Yeah. The deep South.
Your turn.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Where do you live, Mary?
When do you go up?
You prefer women?
No.
You know something.
Maybe you'll think of something...
No. Not that either.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
It could be...
Is it inside the city?
I don't know.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
I don't know... but it does.
Where are you going?
Have any other people ever passed through?
What makes you think so?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Yes...
Oh my... I'll try.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Too little.
Good... You up for a drive?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Right... This just glided along.
Or not so recently?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Yeah, Mack?
What about yesterday?
Coming up.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
A headache?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
That's why I married you.
A videotape.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Two detectives are coming out.
But...
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
Okay.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Sure. Sure I do.
Sheila...
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Thank you.
Fossils, huh?
Well, what do you know about that!
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
That's ridiculous.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
How do you do?
We follow many.
Oh, good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, it must have taken–
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
108 and still active?
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Then it's done.
How can we get in touch with them?
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now—
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
What about the others?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
That fellow got on at Baskul.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Yes.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
It's not even a fucking door.
No. just peace on Earth.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
All the time, sir.
Kay...
Sir--
We wear black.
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I taught kindergarten.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
A what?
There's a god damn good reason.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
What if he's telling the truth?
How does that help me?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
in case I need it?
In case I need it.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
What is it?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
How could it not?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Did it leave?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Anderton, leave.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
What is it?
I am going back.  I see myself there.
She's still alive?
Because I found out about her...
Why?
Yes, you did.
They were performance pieces.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Drowning.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
You're kidding, that's today?
Now look at him...
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
You're certain?
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
I need your help.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I was looking for you...
I wanted to.
No.
I'm a little dizzy...
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Why?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
You look great.
I don't know who that is.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
He's my subordinate!
What?
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
No.  He can't...
Knott!
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
I forgot my glasses.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
But there's still the other two.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Is it a good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Come on. Let's go.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Bullshit.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Well, you look it. You win?
5-5-1.
You driving her?
What's that?
He must have that shit troughed.
Where's Ricky.
A million. Easy.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
I didn't say that.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
Yes. Goodbye.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah?
Taken care of?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
He's not here.
So, it was a draw.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Bullshit...
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
It's not even yours.
Seat belt.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
To keep?
How much was it?
Fuck...
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
This is bullshit, man.
Don't even start.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You would think.
Back in.
You got that right.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Eighty.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
I'm sorry...
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Yeah. I want it.
How much is what?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
It means you got a gun?
Watch it...
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
You rode?
And where do we bring it?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Edinburgh.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Solid, daddy.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
What you say?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Okay, okay.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Who are you?
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
I want to. God knows I want to.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
What?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Did you hear what I said?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
I'm tired of praying.
Down front as always.
I don't think we know for certain.
Just what is your question?
Just what are you saying?
Entirely.
Let me do it then.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
With him?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Did you hear me?!
500.
Let me die then.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
He told you that?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
He's bright.
Am I a suspect?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
I have connections.
Where does he live?
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Who ordered it?]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
I drink.
I'm here.
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Oh...
It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Where?
I don't understand.
I dropped her at home.
That's not a question.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
You got that right.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Because...  I was already dead.
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[No. Why?]
I'm trying, mom.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
What? Who?
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I can take care of myself.
What makes you say that?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I been looking all over for you!
You want me to ride down with you?
Where you going?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
You told me.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
Thank you.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
Oh, I'm fine.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
What?
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
So I'll die without a son.
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Right.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Or her figger.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
I don't drink intoxicants.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
We been had.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
I have a tent to myself.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
I think I heard about that.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
I don't get it.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That's right. We work well together.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
It's possible
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
I didn't mean with me.
Yes, Reverend?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
There's only one worth noticing.
Homosexuality.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Um-hum.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
No.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
The letter from John Doe.
John Doe.
A deal?
Oh.
Take it easy, John Doe.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Have you seen him?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
. . . Tubby?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
I want it as soon as possible.
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
She isn't?
Well, I was thinking that—Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I didn't see anything.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
You don't want to know.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
I have to go face to face.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I'll give you something.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Recruited you from where?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
So what do I say to this guy?
Why?
Okay, stop.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
We won.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
So what do you want to do?
Stay put.
Is the hostage injured?
I ain't interested in your life story.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Greg.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
I've proved that, didn't I?
As a matter of fact, I do.
...Let me just show you.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
The hell I am!
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You let us worry about that.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What do you need?
It's all been transferred.
-- No.
No.
Yes...
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
It's his nature.
The weather.
There is no --
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Why?
He wouldn't say.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
There was no need to kill her.
Some things never change, do they?
Yes.
For what?
This.  No point to it.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Access established.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
LET'S FLY!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Activating Power Scope!
But I've never served a day.
Not another word.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scared.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Something came up.
Same here.
London?
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
How soon can we pull this off?
Might as well put the time to use.
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Ben-jamin.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
The terms will be mine.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
The Big Picture.
And what do you want out of this?
Wanna know what I think?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Luciano is dead?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Uhh - martini?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Stu Miley.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Less.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
<i></i> In what way?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Are you okay??
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You want to come inside?
Aaron?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Who?
You play--left field.
Oh--yeah--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Tunnel?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
You said it!
Great saints!
Oh! Go away.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Oh--Jim!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
We'd better see.
Office of--Senator Smith?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Punch?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
I did--and--and I got right up.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
He did?
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Have I?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
You--don't know it, do you?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Thanks a lot.
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
How are the pigeons?
Oh--you are!
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Well! You don't say!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"So help me God."
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Well--I have got *one* idea--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Susan!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
What do you mean?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
He's lost complete faith in me--
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Order!
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Uh-huh.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Your Honor!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Huh?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Sure!
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Mary - I - excuse me—
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Have lunch.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Hello . . .
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
He's not home, I tell you!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
Okay.
No?
Yes. That is to say—
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
I've got one for Cobb—
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
I'm Chairman.
Me?!
Why not?
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Huh?
Now wait a minute, buddy—
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Not at all.
I write poetry.
Christian Svenson.
Is she home?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What, sir?
You try it.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
One hundred books?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Mr. Cook.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Why's that?
...And I from Phyllis.
Right now?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Good, then go.
No?
What?!
Now we're back on track.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
And the experiment is in here?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
You've done well.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Who was that?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Sure.
Got to.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
Mumford... like the town?
That's right, the fake kind.
What?
What do you mean?
What would you do?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Really? What would it take?
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Life.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
That's... good?
I'm glad.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
You're not the only one...
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Do you think that's what he wants?
Really?
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Is that the question?
I've got three big ones.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
This --
Uh-huh.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
It matters to me.
What about everything? How did this happen?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Holy shit!
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
All new people start with that...
Psych major?
Really?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Well, okay then.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You shall see.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Oh yes, always.
Yeah! Them.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Water turning to blood.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
No you're not.
Why would I do that?
That bad huh?
I have no choice.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
What's it look like!?
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Your mind is so slippery.
Fantasizing... about you.
Or even what it looks like.
I thought you'd never ask.
Hello?
Doctor Heller?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Think positive.
Ummm.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
What about Captain Amazing?
Should I kill them?
Why not?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Curiosity.
Roy.
It's home.
What are you talking about?
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
But there's still only six of us.
SO WHAT?
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Shhh.
No.
Hey... he's gone.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The bazookas?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
Great timing!
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Proceed.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
What do you mean?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Fair enough.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Ah-hh, no.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
Would you like some brandy?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Lisette La Croix.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Yes.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
What are you doing in there?
Why did you give it to him?
What are you talking about?
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Is he alone?
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Cheeco.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Okay, plan B.
That ain't gonna work.
Nothing.
What's the B-G's?
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Me too.
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I just wanted to give you this.
I don't play for no team.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
What it smell like?
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Go for it.
I don't know.
20 minutes?
I don't know.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I don't know.
I'll take you later.
I got my mase.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
No.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Same to you.
What?
I'd like to know what...
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
The gun...
He's dead?
Keep your voice down.
No.
No, that's,..that's fine
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
Nods.
Right.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
I don't think so.
I see. Where is this gun?
You have, huh?
Just put her on.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
No, Ben.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Dad, you're bleeding...
She went.
Yes! Yes!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Walt!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
And he killed every last one of 'em!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
The Blue Men?
To see Dad?
No, that's just it. No.
John, where are we g --
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
I'll tell you a secret.
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
No. No one never did.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
I been out with men.
Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.
I sure as hell hope so.
Thank God.
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
No.
Yeah.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
How you plan to do that?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I --
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Put that damned thing down!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
You were screaming like crazy.
Of course. What's that?
No more fights?
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
And you too, Ninotchka.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
A dress you wear in the evening.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
No, no.
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
That's right.
Shall we tell her?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But you can't...
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
You want me to go in there?
I must get into that country of yours!
On what?
You're welcome.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
And what is your profession?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
I always eat here.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Probably not.
No.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
You must, darling.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Yes... a little white house.
Who cried that one?
They belong to the people.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
All right, I'll listen.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
What?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
I told you to go, madame.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
This will do. 
How do you do, my friend.
My jewels?!
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Is it?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
For what?!
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
I know it well, sir.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
All right.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
What'd you say?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
You're fucking me.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hello ...
I like jazz ...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yes, I understand that.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
You personally?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
When?
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
What?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Some say you are, Rocky.
Who else'd be in your truck.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Yes.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Not word one.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Llewelyn Moss?
No sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
Yes Sheriff.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
To your husband.
Yes. Things fall into place.
That'll be the day.
Llewelyn!
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
That'll work.
What're you doin', baby?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
You know what's goin' on?
She'll be all right?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Is Llewelyn there?
Not a bleep.
No. Do you?
Nobody. Accounting.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Generally around dark. At dark.
Sir?
You've lived here all your life?
Sir?
...Where you want me to put it?
You already have the tent?
What kind of tent?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Let's just call it square.
November the 28th, last year.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
Yessir. I understand that.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Yes?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
That's got two double beds.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
What did I say?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Could I have that in American?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I'm sorry.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
What?
Yeah, me too.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
I gotta go.
You knew Del?!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
George...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I don't know.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Fine.
Umm...
You never know who you'll see.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
No, that should be more than --
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
That is so right.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Half.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
What doesn't?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Wesley...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
A doctor on the show... why?
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
What's wrong with you?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I SAID FORGET IT!
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
David Ravell.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
Gopher, Everett?
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Pullin' ah pants down...
Not out the other side his face, though.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
It's just a symbol, honey -
Not your...
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
It was a powerful air.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
What for?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
Great. You can go in my place.
Not exactly, sir.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I know.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Louder!
Yes, sir!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Everything was different.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Me, too.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
What's stopping you?
Does it still hurt?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, they're for your mom.
Because he's my friend, too.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
That's brilliant.
Yeah. All week long.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Sure.
Yeah.
But it can't wait.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Get the fuck away from me.
This was your department, Junior.
You're an idiot.
Shut up.
You don't look so good.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
No cars.  Feet are faster.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Got us in here, didn't I?
478-0150.
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
What am I, a five year old?
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm sorry, Mom.
Okay.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
What's with you?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Look this is bull...
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
We're like policing the police.
Yeah.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Thank you.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
I said, I'm not my sister.
What unit?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Sir.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Not yet.  What happened?
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
He tried.  It didn't take.
Father?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
I don't care.  I hate him.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Gabriel.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
I am, I think.
How many men have we seen die?
Thank you.
Yes... you will wait.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Worse.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Do you believe that?
Yeah, sure.
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
Yes, but--
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
This time I mean it.
Because it's right.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
It's Ellie's cat.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
And because the dead walked.
Jesus, the road!
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
No you won't.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Or you could surrender.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Did you, now?
Very good.
Commodore, please!
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
I know the code.
The trees are taller.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
More to drink!
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We're catching up!
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
We'll see about that.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
'Bootstrap?'
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Depends.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
You've seen it?
No.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
Where did he come from?
Speak.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
No.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Considering what?
That might work.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Well, you got another problem.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
The waste.
You're the doctor.
No, why?
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Yeah.  Old times.
No problem.
Getting used to it.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Argon's private lab.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
The same thing I suppose.
We were different people then.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
We lost him.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
How-di-do.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Oh, shut up!
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Is that so?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Yes sir!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I didn't run away.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Nothing.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
You don't.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
The name is Smythe.
Yeah.
No, sir!
Yes, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
I'm fine.
I love you too.
I'm sorry ...
She's crying.
But I really should get home.
I was in a bowling-alley.
Oh, gosh no.
So.
With what?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Oh, no thanks ...
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
To who?
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
How come I'm still in black and white?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Hunh?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Well here I am.
Yeah. 
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Call me later.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Tell me why.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
You have a girlfriend?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
I know I did. But I don't.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
No.
I don't know.
Do you know them.
It's terrible, no.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Sure.
Ok.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
....No....
Did you pick it up from the street?
...yes I did...?
Yeah.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
I don't freak out.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I think maybe over a hundred.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Ok, bye, bye.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
....I have seven.
It's alright.
Like a psychiatrist?
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I'm sorry.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Where you goin?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Hi.
What?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Are you serious with this?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
I won't.
Ok.
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Bye, Barry.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
THEN BUGGER ME!
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
Valcour. His chair.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
NEVER!
Yes?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You're a sentimental man.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
You'd suffer in her stead?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
Yes?
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
You've come to lecture me?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Uh-huh
I'll remember that.
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Oh, why is that?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
This picture--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I don't want you to--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
The old man has his own way of doing things
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Orson. Stop. Just stop
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
And what does he see?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
So they're Jews. . .
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Mank!
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Jesus
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
The ad..
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
I really think you're
It was a -joke, George
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
It was the best, kid
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
What?
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
And where you goin'?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Go ahead.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Huh?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
You want the title shot or not?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
But you said "you."
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Nine o'clock.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
With Salvy, eh?
You did?
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
What friends?
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
Right, the gym.
Excuse me for living.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Thanks.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Like an old hambone?
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
With that cast on -- you don't.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I don't know what you mean.
Well, I only quote from the best.
That's abnormal.
Stella!
That's the hard part.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Get back there! He'll see you!
Huh?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Smart girl.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Not yet, Jeff.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Uh-huh.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Lisa! Shut up!
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Something too frightful to utter.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
To get on home.
That's a suitcase?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
The same.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Friend of yours?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Glad to meet you.
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
You still want to go home, Moose?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Yeah!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
What would you do, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Well--
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
Sorry.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I was talking to Jim.
Just relax, please relax!
What's that pounding?
He's home.  I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
I still think you should go down.
Well maybe she better start.
In my mother's drawer.
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
They're still there!
Who knows.  Plato?
I hitched.
Judy.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I know.  Light a match, will you?
No.  At dawn.
Why?
Why should you be the only one.
Grandma?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Pretty mixed up?
Now that's true!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Why?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
So do you.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
What's he like?
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Read a lot about you, Nick.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
Searching for a money man...
-- till he fucked his parole --
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
He'll be dead when he does.
Negative five?
No, hey, I like your coat --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Smile.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Your brother...
You're not hearing me here --
No, Nick, no --
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
A station wagon in Canada.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
How'd you know my name.
What... Powwow...
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Fuckin' freezing.
Not with you.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Three days, man.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
YOU TELL HER!
She set them up. All of them.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
You gave them me.
Well...sorry...
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
The Brewers.
But what is this?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
What for?
Mr. Brown?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Take a seat.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Mr. Pink.
You do?
We think we got a rat in the house.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Nice Guy Eddie.
Joe.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Let's go in the other room...
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
For all I know, you're the rat.
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Of course.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
The who?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Why do you think?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
You don't mean that Clay.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't want to run short.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
I just wondered. Let's go.
You'll live.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Well, say it.
Go ahead.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
That's it then.
Up the trail.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Never happened!
Would you die already?!
Really? That's amazing.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
No. I never date outside my race.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Listen to me I --
Oh.
Let's get a hot dog.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
I'll go.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
What are you getting at, Professor?
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Are these all the subjects?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Hi.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Father, come in, please.
It's okay. I understand.
What she said about your mother?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Ooohhhh!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
No, I don't.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Are we leaving?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
How to send a bill!!
I'll give you fifty cents.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
Thank you.
Yes.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Hello, Frances.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I'll try there.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Goodnight, Mary.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
What things? Why?
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Yes.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
Not from me.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
Uh—huh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I'm very, very serious.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm afraid not.
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Why?
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Please.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Oh.
Television?
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Sister older or younger?
Impotent.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
You had sex with you therapist?
Who's Donna?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
What about sex?
And they just answer them?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
This is just... so...
How did you know?
Don't you want to make one?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Does he go down on you?
Absolutely not.
Yes.
Why?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Why don't I believe you?
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Did you find him attractive?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
He doesn't have a phone.
Will you stop? Jesus.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, I didn't.
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
I don't know.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Apparently.
Cynthia!
You don't know that for sure.
You are in serious trouble.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
What do you get?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
Yes.
Do I sit or stand?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He doesn't have to tell me.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Cynthia, I don't know.
Could be risky.
You're intrigued?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
I like the way he dresses.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
It won't. I trust him.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
A bonfire, probably.
No.
No.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
No. Dotty's the last.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I got it!  I got it!!!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
So it seems.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
SPONSOR!!!
SOLD??!!
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
I don't want to get up there.
But I don't need treadment.
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Absolutely correct.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
What show?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Farley!
F for...
Fast!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
No.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
They're just leftovers.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Want some?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Right now.
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
You're an asshole.
Nope.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Throw me his ball.
No.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Thanks.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
What the fuck!
Whatever. Sorry.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Back at you.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
That's what I'm having.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Ken.
Ken.
So how're you doing?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
About four weeks.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Where?
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
It tastes old.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I heard them Morgan.
Dad!
Explain noises.
No I'm not.
Yes.
I'm looking!
Got it!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Me too.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
I just asked his name.
Where are we going to sleep?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
What about them?
What was the first thing?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
Pinned? What does that mean?
It's like War of the Worlds.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
That's why they got you in jail?
The one with the shotgun.
It was my fault.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
That's it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Is he alive?
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Paden sends his best.
I haven't done anything.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Where's Turley?
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I expect.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
You own this land.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
We'd rather stay.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
Who's the owner?
What do you mean?
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I'm glad we talked.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
I'll send you her resume.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I can imagine.
Impossible.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Of course.
You look so, so...
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
You're with me to be close to her?
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
It was more in passing.
You want me to call Security?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I could get the death penalty.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I know what you're up to.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
What do you want -- ?
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Dr. Crowe.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Yeah. Sorry.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
Words.
What kind of words?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
I don't know.
Soon. One week.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
What?
Yeah.
They talk to you?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
It's our pleasure.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
Not lately.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Book of Jeremiah.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Metaphysical question, man.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I don't think so.
People say he was a murderer.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
He's right. You were behind.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Is that right?
Yeah?
Name something.
No --
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
No. Not without you --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
Second verse!
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Why bother?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Sorry.
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
No, Starla! No!
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What?
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
If...?
You know how rumors start.
You paying for the gas?
Who'd want to?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
You have a great profile.
You just passed your nemesis.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
Hey...
I would've come back for you.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
But you'll do it?
You sure do.
Or in the slammer.
No.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Six. Got it.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
They're jammed!
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Yes, ma'am.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
My debrief --
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
None whatsoever.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
What were you doin' here anyway?
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
Fuck you.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
You'll end up like me.
You fucking bastard...
He's dead.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
Rheya.
Probably.
Who are you trying to convince?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
When?  When I'm asleep?
No.  I love you.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Rheya.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
If you're here.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I can't stay here.
I can't --
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
It's an experiment.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
No, Ma'am.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
How did you know?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Oh that thing in Queens.
Do you dance?
Yeah.
"To"... Forget about you.
Yeah...
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
You got no idea...
You don't want to hear about it.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Where'd you get the tie?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Did you hear what I said?!!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Call a cruiser!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Be nice.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I know.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Lemme down, bugface!
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Yeah--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Just call me Spidey.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Hi, Adele.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I know what you mean.  I...
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Waldos.
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
That's the understatement of the year.
I'm a photographer, remember?
No.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
No…
Like it?
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
So long, Sefton.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
And maybe a little something else?
Twenty-five.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Sefton!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
What are the chances busting out of here?
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Jawohl.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You're teasing me again!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
It's that song, Harry!
No. I want to draw.
You have a Lieutenant here...
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Says who?
Borscht?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Okay, Price. You stay.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Shoot!
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Are you questioning me?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
We have no radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
HoS qorDu. 
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Commander.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
One minute to warp core breach.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Left behind?
Soran?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Please, please.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Yes.  Thank you.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Is there a problem?
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Underground deposit?
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
My readings indicate great instability.
That may be difficult...
I have already made one transmission too many...
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Do you have an explanation?
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
With some on the planet...
No, sir, no response.
Indisposed, sir.
Wait! Give me a chance --
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Then, how --
... The needs of the few...
What you ask is difficult.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Yes, my lord!

We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Carol!
Is that a poem?
I know, I know...
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
He's on a build up to detonation!
I'm trying, David.
The Admiral's son.
Oh, I believe it.
Visual --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
A few shots, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Aye, sir.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
How far?
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Aye sir --
Be careful, Jim...
Scotty, can we make it inside?
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Or the one.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I failed to resolve the situation.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Stop engines.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
He's very human.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
To Earth. To offer testimony.
... They do, indeed.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
We've done it before.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
I liked him better before he died.
Well nobody's perfect...
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Iowa.
It's his way.
Hm?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
... You have a point...
Permission granted.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
I have.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
... Simple logic.
For example?
Yes?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
The hell I can't
... I see.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Two?
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
I am better.
Perhaps, that is true.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
May I talk to you alone?
Do you have everything you need from command?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Why was Data assigned?
Wine, women and song.
... I believe you...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Are you saying they won't help us?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Bag him.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
No.
Do it.
Ready quantum torpedo.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
You don't sound French.
Yes.
Something wrong with that?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
How did you know about that?
Or...?
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
On screen.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Fire.
Go to manual.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
We DO sleep lying down.
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
Specifically of...?
No way.  You see this?
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Yes...
Yes.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
They'll be here...
He's got it.
And your coat.
It IS possible.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Aye, sir.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Kronos, sir?
Right -
I always wanted to try that.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Where?
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
But I am not human. I am only -
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Visual!
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No. I must deactivate you.
Yes.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Well then... only one way to go.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Yes.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
I don't believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
How could I not?
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
This isn't about me anymore.
Do you have life support?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Sir?
Ready, sir!
New Praetor?
Captain!
On screen.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
And the Romulans invade.
Yes.
Yes.
I have no reason to.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
I see more than what you are.
But you want to.
We're being hailed.
I came this far alone ...
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?

I don't see anything.
I don't think so... 
Make any money?
Stay right there...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
When can we expect containment?
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
Okay...
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
What.
Coupons.
X...
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
You'll see.
I know.
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
No.
Candy.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Three nights... two days.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
No.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I am your friend.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You're damn right I am.
Nothing.
But...
I know how to gamble now.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Call the police!!
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
I don't know where he is.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
No.
No, sir. Radar.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
We can't let you do that.
Bullshit politics.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Make me forget it, baby.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
You should feel like shit.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
So've I.  Too much.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Why me?
Is he dead?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
What clip?  What was it?
I already got everything I need from you.
Strickland.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Define illegal.
Let's talk in the car.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
You'll see.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Uh unh.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Take the tape to the cops.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Testa?
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Hi there.
A grill pattern.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
What's wrong with me?
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I was looking for a pattern.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
They're all criminals?
"Gone live?"
You got a point there.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Oh.
And nobody else can do that?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
And you're working with him?
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
I...
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Sit back.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yes, sir.
How's the arm?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
Those were just fantasies.
Maybe you should back off.
Yeah.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Speck is dead.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Ever since I've known you.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Mike...
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
Could you believe it?
I'm a comedian.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Who's your booking agent?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
I can call back...
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
I didn't mention her once today.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
There's the rub.
Him?
I'll be your winger.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
They turned you down?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
She's really special, guys.
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I don't know...
What?
Vegas.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I'm telling you!
How?
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...It looked money.
It's on.
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
We're not messing with you...
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
...double diamond...
...shivering...
...Yeah.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's definitely on.
...Definitely...
Be smart about it.
I'll be back with the coffee.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
No.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
I know.
Where are you going?
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
You look good, too.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
Right.
They're talking to themselves.
Who is he?
Yes.  Tell me.
What time do they expect us?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
He talked to you?
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I played piano in a few places.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Marge and I are getting married.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
Have you done something to your hair?
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Bird. That's jazz.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Oh Marge.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
He says so many fiancées.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I really don't want to see anybody.
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
Absolutely.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Who mam?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
The DMZ?
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You must be rich.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
No, why?
No, why?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
And what happened?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
One-Ball McCall?
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
He looks like a killer.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
Cops don't do nothin.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Oh?
You would, huh?
O.K., cowboy.
I'm here to see Iris.
Slow.
The taxi life, you mean.
Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
Don't let him do that.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
What's that?  Mason?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Dad... 
I do?
Whoa.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Exactly.  And he got good.
No kidding.
Thanks.
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
No, sir.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
By all means.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
Ah.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Thanks.
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I was decorated.
Exactly.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Cat.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Yes?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Yes.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes.
All right. 
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
And what had you done?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Mom, they're in a cage!
Don't you like us?
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Is she all right?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Where would I get a boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Yes?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
I don't know.
You're doing fine.
No, not exactly.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
I wish I could be that way.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Oh.
Aren't these lovebirds?
I didn't break that window!
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
How do you know Annie?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What did it say?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
His wife changed the channel.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
What do you do?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Helping travelers.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
What?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
Don't let's take any chances.
How long have they been gathering there?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
You must be exhausted.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
What do you suppose it is?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
How?
With smoke.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Not if they're starting a war.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Then let's go. Now!
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
Aye.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Only Brother.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Yes, Doctor.
Three years.
She would if she could.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
So you're going to kill him?
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It still doesn't mean...
Please. Come inside.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Yes -- that is true.
Would you care to be more specific?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
About five months -- your months.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
You ready?
Is it real?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Who?
At the ship.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
But I suppose you know the answer.
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
El Vampiro.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
Did we have a date tonight?
I'll hitch.
No.  I'm up.
We are...
I'm tired now.
Mom... please.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
No, I'm not...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Lucy.
-- a job.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Let's go see them.
When?
I know, I've felt it...
Huh?
So do I!
Will you give Mom a break?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No.  Why?
No.
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Just listen.
I know.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
What?
Ain't it there?
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
You lying bastard...
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
That's good enough.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Neither will we.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
That far?
No.
I am going after them.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Move it, Palmer.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Screw the generator!!
Calm down and get in your position.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
No...
1899.
But you escaped.
Yes.
What?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
No...
Because...
Why is it -- breaking up?
What?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
No... let's walk through the city.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
Do you find her?
You wouldn't believe me.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Good night, Alex.
Mm.
He's gone to a better place.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Why not?
All of you?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Yes... I suppose so.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
That'll be all.
Exactly correct, sir.
I took a different route.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're inside --
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
But... what about Starks?
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How...how are you here?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
No, we were patients.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
What?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
William, you're not making sense.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
I never knew my father. Did you?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
You have no idea what's going on.
Maybe.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
So what am I supposed to do?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
[Beat] Thanks.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Uh-huh.
What?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
That's certainly possible.
A .38.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Louise is alright.
How?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Who's your friend?
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Can't it go to any office?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Maybe.
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Isn't this fun?
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Maybe.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
You're not touchin' that car.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Have another drink, Thelma.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Alright, Louise!
Whaddo we do?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
Yeah, you want it?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Yup.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You too, sweetie, the best.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
He implied it.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Relax, he just ate.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Am I?
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
I already know it, Mary.
Are you... an architect?
Great.
Deco.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Lint?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
A fucking moron.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You want her dead, don't you?
So she hasn't changed?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
I never said that.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
I don't watch the new ones.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Oh Jesus...
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hm?
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
What are you?
Mary, come on...
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
I wish.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
We can't do that, Bobby.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
I think it's a bad idea.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
He was.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Dean Rusk!
Yeah.
No you weren't.
No way.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
James Looks Twice?
Tell him, Ray.
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Cuz I want New York.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Watch out!
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
I don't see the connection.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Crow Horse, listen --
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Go ahead, Ray.
Good.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
I'm with someone.
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Yes, ma'am.
On his six.
Apology acknowledged.
Lieutenant...
What are you talking about?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What about the plane?
You're an animal.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Take something off.
I live here, remember?
F-14's sir.
Yes sir!
Let's hope you're right!
He better be kidding!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
I know!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Just relax.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
What?
I've had enough...for now.
I want him!
Let's go. Eject.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
What'd you do?
Skipper, you can't do this!
IT'S MY SHOT.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
I've seen this before.
Helping him in.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
The wings..
Yes sir.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
All right.
My wife's house.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Who are you?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Definitely.
Thank you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Relax, you'll live longer.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
You tell me.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
You went to Rekall, remember?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
What is it?
Split up.  Find him.
Come on!
The door opened.  You got it.
You know I do.
All right, forget about it.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
--I got a trip to Mars.
I'm not your wife.
And falling in love?
It's time you found out.
Nice to meet you.
Right.  Mars.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Oh, since when?
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, who put you two in charge?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Nope, there!  That's one.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
I'm gonna help you.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
We need another plan.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
Not yet, not yet...
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
You are so full of shit...
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
The con...!  Oh my God.
God, what a stink!
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Good point.
An hour after you picked it up!
Please... I need to sleep...
He was your snitch.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Where's the nearest hospital?
Sustained.
-- With objection!
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
What about entrapment?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
You really think that's what happened?
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
...What do you mean?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
That's why I hate experts.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
-- Roger -- ?
What's Art Esparza?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
-- Me? Neither.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
Screw you too, Kitty.
Want to tell me what went down here?
I killed the motherfucker.
About Chinatown. What went down.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
-- Every word.
And its purpose?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
That's right.
A woman.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
I want you to kill for me.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
Okay, Gordon!!!
No, sir, we did not.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
That's what I heard.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Call me.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
No.
How did the car get back here?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
What'll it be?
I haven't got it yet.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
Send me a kiss.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
When am I going to see you?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
You know it and I know it.
What?
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Boating?
No.
You'd think so.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I understand.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
What did he find?
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
It looks that way.
No.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Tell us.
...that's all right.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
That's what I'd planned to...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Well...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
You're going to settle out of court?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Yes...
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
That's perfectly all right.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Yes. It was, actually.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Yes.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Yes. Price...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Who are you protecting, then?
It's locked?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
Don't touch anything.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
Yeah. I'm awake.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
The broad has disappeared...
In New York?
Yes, that's correct.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
But I think I know where she'll be....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Can you handle one of these?
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
It's always been a good persuader.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I'll be there in three hours.
Diabetes?
Is he all right?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Here.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Seemed, not was.
You got it.  What's happening?
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
Yes.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Then what is he doing?
Uh...sure...when?
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
I just can't believe it.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
It was a bad dream...
I guess.
Me too.
Ya know... "It".
Come on man, what'd they look like?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
No.
Take good care of my son.
And, of course, we are.
Why are you here?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
She's Cuban.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
May I ask you something?
Y'all take American Express?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Sorry to hear it.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Muchas gracias.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
What happened to him?
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What's that, honey?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
What's that, peanut?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
You do.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
You're scarin' me, baby.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Went with Bobby.
He's the kind liked it.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Whattya mean?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Only in your bones?
Which is?
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
In a sense.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
No. There's no one here.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
A little.
So I'm told.
Really.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Can I ask you something about her?
I put you on the floor.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
Who?
No.
I never heard of it.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
No thanks.
When nobody's looking.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
No, it's not that, it's...
I got the message you called too.
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Neither do I.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
About the baby.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
And what did you say?
I'm not sure that's possible.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Her husband.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Ah, right. The book.
Just kidding.
No, I'm going ho --
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
How is she?
Nothing.
In that birch tree is a nest.
It's hard to describe.
Okay.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I fell asleep.
Woodsman?
I was asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
What's with the boxes?
Yes.
Yeah.
Why's that?
No you're not.
Are you sure?
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
You should go home.
I said the job is okay.
Honest? No.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
How do they know?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
What did you want to happen?
I don't know!
I want you to calm down.
You mean my problem?
That's my answer.
In my bed too.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Nothing.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I'm talking about you.
What?
Doesn't it get noisy?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
Because I like you.
The worst?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Twelve years in prison?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Walter.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Most people say the odds are against me.
No you don't.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
No.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Wilhite, anything?
How many are there?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
She'll wait.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
What! After giving us such a run around...
We'll send the raft back to you.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But how could you say such a thing?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
But then when will we see each other?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
And what about you?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
Aren't you going to change?
I deserve it.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
Who's moving?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What is it?
Why don't you try?
What other boat?
Unfortunately, no.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
What do you mean?
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Uh huh.
You've been alone together?
And what happened?
From God.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Why not?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No... do you?
Why should I?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
A mistake...
A mistake... it was a mistake...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
I'm always bad.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Doctor Livingston.
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
May I open my eyes now?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Yes.
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
What?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Do you still go to church?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Why do you think that?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
Aquittal.
How?
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Answers.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, God.
Don't deny it!
Stupid woman... and that's all?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Hand rolled.
She's been touched by God, yes.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
The baby?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well --
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
I'm a deserter, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Bag-snatcher.
Of course I can.
Ta.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
He's sulking again.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Thank you.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
What?
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
That's all right then.
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
So's mine.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
No, not me.
Oh yes.
I would have said so.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Thanks.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Well ...
He'll get over it.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Don't exaggerate.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Nerves.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
He can't be far.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Well we better do something.
How does he breathe?
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
How's Broussard?
Still unconscious?
Can you do anything for him?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
I can't, the acid will pour out!
I'm trying.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
No, it's coming.
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
We've got about a week left, right?
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Good.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Where are you?
Now what?
I guess we open the door and net it.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Sure.
What's happening?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Keep trying!
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
How?
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Auto-shop?
Which mean physically going outside.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Is that a fact.
Four.
And before that?
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
What can I do?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie what?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Yes, you did. You still do.
What do you mean by that?
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
You can have one at Max's.
Because I don't want to.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You're being childish.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You were there? At the play - last night?
She may be later than you think...
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Eve! My understudy...
I take it she read well.
That's nice.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Show me a human and I might have!
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
I don't think that's funny!
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
- guilty.
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
What would you like? Texas?
Yes, dear.
Just wondered what?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
So am I.
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How did you get in here?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Try...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
You won't forget it?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Please...
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
The curtains. I made them myself.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Well...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve?
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
To you, too?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I never said it was!
I have no intention of having an accident!
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Promise.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I was sure trying.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Were you eyebrow reading?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
Whatever.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I'm so glad.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Mind if I try?
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--yes--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
...No... never in so many words...
What do you want to know?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
I will not talk about the other two.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
OK.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Ratfucking.
Talk about Segretti--
James McCord.
No.
But it's possible.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
I won't talk about the other two.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You called me Oz.
Yeah right.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
Uh...
It's all good.  Breath check.
Pontificated.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
I suppose that would be okay.
Shame on you!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Just a second!
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Me too.
Yeah.
What?
I'm such a loser.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I don't care.
Shut the fuck up.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No way.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Just like sex with my wife.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I don't know...
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Fuck me...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
You too.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You'll never get the chance.
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Andy? Andy is that you?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
How well did, er, do you know him?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
Yes, your highness.
It's not you - it's the dress!
I'm sorry.
No! Well, yes, but
Is it? Is this what you want?
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Promise me she'll have her home.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Come on.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
What do you mean, next?
Portchnik.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Lyndon Johnson?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Well, stop listening to him.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
You want your gear? Here you go.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Good? I was-
Here, you want some?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Yeah.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
David? You call your teacher David?
It's his name.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Yeah?
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
Oooh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Holy cow!
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
You're mad, aren't you?
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
What-
Jesus!
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I mean that as a compliment.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh, Jesus.
You wanna lie down?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
I look pretty.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Hey-
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
One guess.
Absolutely.
Who, Sally?
Leo?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd say it was down.
Just don't fucking tell her.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
So where is young Jonah?
Yeah.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Please?
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Oh.  You're them.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Are you always this much fun?
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
You only made half your quote this year.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Don't.
It's a Calder.
Will you make love with me?
Lovely.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Oh.
What?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Let's go for a walk.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Yes.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
The charades.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
How?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
I guess.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
I hope they're watercolors!
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Right...because every ant's important!
Really?
No...as a matter of fact...
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Want a list?
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Well...no, but --
Of course not --
Yes...he's wonderful...
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
You mean tonight?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Why?
I don't understand --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
His apartment?
Open it.
Give what up?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
A bad insurance risk?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
A what?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
I mean, after that?
Fine.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
In there.
Seven --  -- queen.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
What for?
I don't know.
You do?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Are you going to deny it?
I'm not through with you yet.
Oh?  Oh!
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
I got kicked in the head, too.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
You?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Let me get my bag.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
No.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Will you excuse me?
Let me take that.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
That's enough, Fran.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Stop that, Fran.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Yeah --
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Yeah.
My men --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Which part is that ?
Fat. That's real fat.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
A sauciere --
What are you doing out here?
Probably is.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Yeah, I know.
I never heard about that.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Ours.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
Yeah.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
What, sir?
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
I got bored in Saigon.
Haiphong.
Can you trust them?
Who knows.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Music?
I'm Kurtz.
You know you're right.
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
You can't have water after morphine.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
I was on threshold of great things.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Any time -- us -- Americans.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
And shut up.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
I know.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
What?
23   CONTINUED:  
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
139  CONTINUED:

How did she..?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Why?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Was there any trouble?
Not me.  I'm equipped.
I'll tell you everything later.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
How many do you see?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
We were just talking about him.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
His name?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Lovely.
Two days.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
No.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
And?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Okay.
Fries.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
I can trust my brain.
Were you asleep?
Were you asleep?
Because...
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
He's a pain in the ass.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Absolutely.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Get out.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Right.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Bullshit.
What?  What's okay?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
What does that fucking mean?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
What?
I don't believe you.
The contract was stolen.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
I bet you fucking know!
Robert?  Robert?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Why?
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
They tried to kill you?
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
You were there?
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
What happened?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
Yes.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Who was she?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
Martin.
What?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
A dime.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
And not even then sometimes.
Fifteen crowns.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
So why didn't we?
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
Tell me some bad news?
He got that one right.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
Do you know the way?
Yeah, pretty well.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
I hope so!
But we could go to London and live in England.
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Great....How long will it go for?
Yo, dobree!
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
What is bail?
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Uh-huh!
How did he look?
Why don't we both forget about him?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
A drill, what are you up to?
Come on, that shit can wait.
Just yesterday.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Yes, if you can get him free.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You are quite sure it's secure?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
I do.
Why not?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I'm just wondering --
And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
Demented.
Scamming's a strong word.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
-- This your idea of small talk?
You don't know me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
-- This play means a lot to me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Because that's where the fire is?
Kinda. Yeah.
Go for it.
It's private.
Ambitious.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Do you think I'm strange?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Your father doesn't like me.
You don't miss a thing.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You don't know what you want --
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
Where's the one you're building?
What about your father?
Pull over.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
But if you could, you would?
Up to?
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
You decide.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
She did. It was you.
For pay?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, hi....
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
What drill?
Learn anything?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Lemme see that.
And where am I gonna be?
Why?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Run out of gas?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
AM or PM?
Oh, right, right... 
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Why?
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
What if you lost your keys?
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Jesus!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
What did you do to your hair?
They come with the house.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
No, you're not either.
You love him?
No.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Yeah.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Really?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
To get my guns.
You.  Like the papers all say.
It's kinda hard this way.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
I didn't drop 'em.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Bill –
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I need help, Audrey.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
And I could tell you some stories –
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
No... no...
You gotta believe me –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
I apologize, Barton.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
The others are being sent.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
No.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Yes.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I have nothing to hide.
I loved him.  I hurt.
That's right.
Why not?
You know all about me.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
To see if he can get away with it.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Fine.  How's your back?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Why?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
Somebody has to die.
How's that?
Were there ever any suspects?
That's him.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Say what?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
I said keep it.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
What about me?
She killed him.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
What about the shit they write?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
Aren't they?
You want a drink?
How about right now?
I know.
How do you know?
What do you mean?
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Very well.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
You don't have any fucking money..
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
How is he?
What's that about?
Hi.
Wanna Mac?
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I think I'll take the stairs.
We do.
Wrong on both counts.
You're not the Mayor.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Nor I, on the second.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Silent night, violent night...
Well it's not working.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Too good?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Yes?
That, sir, does not compute.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Be ready for anything.
I didn't kill your wife.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
I see you knew him.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
I wish I knew.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
I find that unlikely.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Hardly a worry, sir.
Apology hastily retracted.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
What do maniacs always want?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
You are direct, aren't you?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Wait. You can't go.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Not much.
What? This isn't normal?
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Well, I met someone...
I don't-.
You do know. Try.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Here. Get a good seat.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Shouldn't we --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Odd desire for anyone.
... Terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
And what happens if we say no?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Holy shit...
What were you thinking?
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Holy shit. Holy...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Did you really ask?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
About Charles...
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I beg your pardon?
You're not going to ....
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Certainly is.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh... butt-snatch...
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
I see it. I don't get it.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Not now Bork.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Who knows?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
We're...
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
Our cemetery?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
I... I don't know what your name is.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Delia hates it.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Yes, Robert. I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Thank you, Robert.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Yes. Thank you.
Hello, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Of course.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you, Eve.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
I don't want Robert.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, I understand.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
I see, Ben.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Oh, I see.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
I want to tell Eve.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
... Oh.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Of course. I would like to look.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I am a very serious gardener.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
1952...?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Yes, ma'am.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
It's not that, I just...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
I said good night!
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Malkovich!
I never played a jewel thief.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
Which one is Elijah again?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
The ferret?
The iguana.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
You bastard.
I need a shower.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Why not?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
I like that.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Yes, Hi.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Who's calling?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Folks come. Folks go.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I will.
Oh.
Yes ma'am..
Be here. In case.
Well, what can you do?
Could be that fall you took.
Morning, ma'am.
Go upstairs I said!!
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
He ask, I give him anything.
It's her, ain't it?
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Never found out.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She was my best thing.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Oh, nothin', you know.
What--
Huh?
That fucking bitch!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
It's already posted.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
What's that, Walter?
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Nancy's pretty good.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Heh-heh--
What's your drink, Dude?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
"Johnson"?
Excuse me?
I was talking about my rug.
He fixes the cable?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Yeah, but what about--
That's really thoughtful but I--
The main guy, Dieter--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Yeah, but--
Theodore Herzel.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Calmer than you are.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Just for making the hand-off?
Huh?
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
Huh?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
No.
Is this your homework, Larry?
It is a fucking emergency.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
No Dude.
Wha.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Fuckin' A.
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Stay away from me, mister!
Am I wrong!?
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
I'll heal.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
I don't think so.
For what?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Took you long enough.
Either that or feeding the worms.
What do you really think?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
Not alone.
Too bad you're out of it.
Getting your attention, Paco.
From his father, of course.
Any casualties?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Going on twenty years now.
Don't even start, old man.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
Who is LaMagra?
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Graffiti --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
Deacon brought me back.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What're you doing there?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Think again.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I haven't killed any--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
--bullshit!
Here.
--hours before--
--no one'll ever know.
Yeah.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
What?
What're you doing with all this shit?
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
What?
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--turn the camera off--
--now there.
Asleep--
--I dunno, I just woke up--
All I need--
--oh, Jesus--
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Ancient runes--
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
What'd you say?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Heather.
Okay. Hypothetically.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
Your husband.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
You're bad.
What the hell happened, Ray?
...What was that?
I don't follow baseball.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Lubbock?
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
See, I never knew that.
...Hell.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Got a job for you.
It's not strictly legal.
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Pour that back.
What.
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
What?
Okay honey.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Never before this.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Yes.
No. I should go.
That's good.
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I think I better go.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
That's too bad.
Where are they?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
That sounds good.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Who, me? Why should it?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Really?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
... Sandy?.
uh uh.
Good deal Dad.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
This is it.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah. okay.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
No.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Get me a six pack.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
No?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
No, my brother.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
That's my George, always thinking.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Who's the cheapskate?
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
It would be my pleasure.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Power?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
I like fire.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
You mean, like a trip?
There's schools in California.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
It depends on you.
Second name.
Second district ... Explain better ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
A name?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
You got something on the coke?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
An inquiry into what?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
That's what my report will read.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
I had a bad heart.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
She didn't.  She just left.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
No.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
What happened?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
Tastes can change.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Are you scared?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
That wasn't the deal.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
No, Your Honor.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
How often do you use cocaine?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come to me?
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
What time did you leave?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Mom's orders.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Michael.
What?!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Don't say that!
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Yeah.
WHAT!
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
What's he like?
And clean.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
What?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
No, I'm just saying --
I already apologized.
Am I interrupting anything?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Yeah. See you later.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
Oh, how is he?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
How about Italy?
Near the church.
Trouble. Why?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
How the hell should I know?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
What the hell you talking about?
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
And the hell everybody else, right?
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Lucky thing.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Patrick, he's...
You got the shit?
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
That's the past.  It's dead.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
Should I?
Ours!
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
What's that, Johnnie?
Admit what?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
All right!  Where's the key?
What are you talking about?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Stay away!
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
Who are you going to call?
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
Shut up!
I knew I couldn't trust you.
It's all right, sir.
Oh, right.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
...  thank you.
You're doing everything yourself?
'63 Chevy.
You have to ask?
Basically.
Almost five years.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I don't understand - ?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Yes.
Is that what you think?
Then what?  Exactly.
To let it dry.
Any bodyguards?
Shit!  Oh shit!
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
Yes.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I want a second opinion.
I'm not asking.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?

One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
We thought you were gone for good.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I want to go home.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?

When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
-- you could put it together --
I can't believe I slept.
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
I trusted you.
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Think I could rent a scooter?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
Hang on... 
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
Where am I?
<u>Where am I</u>?
I don't remember Zurich.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Got there!
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
You must save the day.
Her name is Jill.
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Triplets.
SAM! What a surprise!
Are you officer 412/L?
What is it?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
So how ...?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
A terrorist?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
What?
Stamped?
Who are you?
What?
Where are you taking me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
What?
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Take care.
27156789/074328/K.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
I want to talk to him.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
I ... uh ...
Who's that? 
What? Who is this?
Er, don't you want to search me?
No, sir.
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Numero, trois.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Have you got one or haven't you?
We'll be back.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Mary said you might be coming.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Sure, sure, give go.
Yeah?
Oh man, Bucky.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
Okay.
He's better.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Promise you won't go inside.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
There's no time.
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I think the worst is over.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
What's wrong.
What look?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
What do you think?
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
I don't know--let's break some windows.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
What?
You're burned out.
Yeah, you're right.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Oh, stop it.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Fifty, right?
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
No.  Don't worry about it.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
No.
Then what was good about it?
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
How?
Really?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
You didn't say anything to her?
Yeah --
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Yes, there is.
Should I...
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
You don't have to finish tonight.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
That actually goes on...
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
How's it going?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
Yeah?
I'll be the judge of that.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Yes.
Why, you need me for the story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Yeah.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Well, when?
I know.  I taped it.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
That's yes?
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Go ahead -- what?
I'm sorry.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
He made a cat.
A thing I made.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Better!
Every word...
Are you ready?
Bye!
What are you trying to say?
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Why not?!
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Leonard, what are you doing?
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
I know, man.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
I didn't buy it I made it.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Well...
They are?
It was.
Well, w-what did you do?
Never mind...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Telling you what?
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
If you see him.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Hi, guys.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I do?  I guess I do.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I know.
Thanks.
Merrick...
What for?
I should have known.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Why?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Cramps?
What?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Put your head back.
They were vampires?
Not if you're careful.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
They don't even have Dolby.
My parents have money...
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Could be.
Oh, baby!
Well, I hope so.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Wit-tay.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Run.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
My right nostril?
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Nuke?!
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
What a nasty thing to say.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Oh--won't YOU come in?
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
I'll learn.  C'mon--
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
It's possible.
Why not?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
What?
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
You need a nickname.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
We gonna fuck or what?
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
You're a cocksucker!
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Boring.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Jesus.
Then go.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You're a great catcher.
What?
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Hit me in the chest with this...
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Okay...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
What are you talking about?
Was I at that dinner?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
Wh-wh -
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Oh, no, please, please.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
How did Nicky collect?
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Thanks, pal.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
No, I don't wanna come -
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
All right.
My wife?
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
And they were usually right.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
What can I do?
Ace, listen to me.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
I-I'll do it.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Yeah, I know all that.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I don't need one.
No, you don't.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
With what?
He needed some clothes.
Mm-hm.
I bought him a watch too.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Get out of here!
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
Mm.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
Don't you threaten me!
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
I am calm!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
No.
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Yeah.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
You gotta go back out there.
Hi. Good.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
Carmine's gone.
How are you?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Ma che cazzo!
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Sure.
Yeah.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yeah.
But I saw something...
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
No, Lester.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
...they're in Penthouse K.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
Yeah?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I'm positive.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
This looks promising...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Winning.
What do you want from me?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
I know.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
You think so?...Selina?
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
What did--?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
You are...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Don't you have children?
Did you have to tell her my name?
Then whose is it?
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
Make a "U" and go back.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I've got to ask somebody.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Include me in that.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
The guy with the transplant.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
Do you have to point that?
What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?
Did you hear that?
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
They saw you kill the driver.
Keep talking.
There are no guarantees in this life.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
So who's he?
It's him, isn't it?
Charming.
Fucking mad!
Off his wages.
What's his name?
Scottish?
Who's she?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
That's good...
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
You say that like a gentleman.
Like you're concerned.
Did he dance with you?
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Sure I do.
Made me feel all funny inside.
What condition?
Jimmy?
Did you hear me?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More what?
What would you do for me?
Never.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
I promise.
That's wise, Tommy.
Do you now.
Suits you.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
What do you mean?
Of course. I forgot.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Would make me feel better about it.
I understand.
And who is she?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
So, what do I look like?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
My pleasure.
Could you?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Ever see hurling?
Tree.
Hurry up, would you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Why?
Like what?
My special friend.
It's as simple as that?
What does that mean?
No.
People. They could be looking.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
Give me the fucking shooter!
What?
What about it?
Adam --
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Look.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
May I have a sandwich, please?
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
That's the spirit.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
You'd lie about anything.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Open it.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Then who does?
Me?
Or you --  Or you --
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Said what?
What are you doing?
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
What? Assassinate somebody?
I don't believe it.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
Meaning what?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Leave me alone -- !
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm very cold.
I don't know.
Okay.
What should we give him?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Shakespeare never said that.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Don't you understand French?
I wasn't --
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
What was it?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Va jouer, mon ange.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
I've never seen him before.
Oh la vache!
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
No honey.
She's not here.
No, you couldn't.
Daddy....
What?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
I really do. For your own safety.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
NO?!
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I did.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I'm making you feel like meat?
This party is sick.
What?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Attacked how?
Why not?
How could you?
The word is Mob.
The principal?
Just thinking about something.
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Ok.
Yes. Unfair to me.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
I need your help.
I got, uh....
No.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
No, no, no.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
 No...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...I believe in live and...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
 Oh...
...Night Shift, but you might...

Ho, ho...
Yeah...
 Aw, shit  

...you're dealin' with!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

Oh, shit!
No!
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Yeah, I know, I know.
Are you all right?
We're gonna die!
Arlo!  Arlo.
Yeah.
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go! 
Okay.
We've got Elvis!
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Ooh.
Be cool.  Be--
We're worried...
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
So...where's my truck?
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You-You can't let him...
We've got it...
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
You'll kill us all!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
You look fit...healthy...
Mm-hm.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Radio the bikes.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY.
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...screwup?
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...gear?
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...dangerous.
...deer.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
I assume you have one.
Not tonight...
Like I say, Doc Long's...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...-spite the mouth.


I would've in another life.
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...-time,  remember?
Kabula's out.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Get ready to take it out!
...son.
Uh-huh.
...colonel?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
My secret?
He's brains without ambition...
...without caution...
...is death.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What?
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
...tunnel!
God!  They're gonna seal it.
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...seriously.
...stole a truck under arrest.
...there's a colonel...
...we're all gonna die in this...
All right, go.
The usual.  Doc.
...-damn phone.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
I think I gave it to her.
Do you know him?
We worked in Chinatown together.
That's too bad.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Maybe.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
What is it?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
What are you talking about?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Oh they don't?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Off the alley.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
But what?
How'd you get past the guards?
Looking for someone.
No.
No. It was an accident.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Let me show you something.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
C'mon I'll show you.
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I don't want to drop it.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
But he wasn't killed.
Did he know?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
They can't be.
I gave everybody the night off.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
...No. Why was it.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
He owns it. You know?
What about?
I will if you don't.
Sure.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my daughter.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I cut myself shaving.
I said, the northwest valley.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
I'm afraid so.
Of course not.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
Gittes.
He owned it.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
Where is he?
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
That's a long story.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
We've got a nice plant here.
And the notice?
Has he said when he'll finish?
I'm sure that's it. 
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Emily -
Emily, you -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Charlie, please don't -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I didn't say.
Would you sing for me?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Yes.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
Do you know what that is?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Why not?
Look out that window.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Yes and no.
I'll have a highball.
Am I sure?
Are you serious?
I'll just take the gum.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Yeah, but not in here.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Look how full of yourself you are.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
He's your fiancé.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Call the police.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
In a second!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Yeah.
So?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
What smells like shoe polish?
What do you two fight about?
Allan Harris.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
How do you mean?
It would stand to reason, yes.
I think they were Catholics.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Nudie booth?
I guess not.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
I know.
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
At least we're stuck here together.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Then where're we gonna play?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Exactly. They drank it all.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
No, you're not.
Why not?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You hate people.
How'd he die?
That's embarrassing?
No!
What?
What?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
No way!
Because I'm here.
You're kidding.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I think four.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Fuck you.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Am I right or what?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Got one. Just pulled up.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
How much can you bench?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
No, she's getting married.
I should start.
It's not my store.
What's that mean?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Why do you say that?
And I actually date you?
Twelve.
You're a pig.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three including you.
Who?
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
He gets off on it.
You sucked his dick!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
What is it?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I don't want to go back with her...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
Randal...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Well, how about these two movies? 
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Twenty bucks?
Bye. 
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Who's shooting?
I don't know.
I copy.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
I did what I thought was right.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don't think you do.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Don't worry about me, just go.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
There, what's that place?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
I've been cured.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
It's alright, thank you.
Do you feel that way now?
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
What job and how much?
Helping you, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Well - I'm back.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Aye.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Crime?
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Good. I'm glad
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Sixth is faster.
You got a deal.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Yes.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Jesus...
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
'Fraid so.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Very generous.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Hang on.  Carefully...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
It's home.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
I don't think I can do this.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Why?
So what?
No you don't.
I listen to classical.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
You mind?  I'm working here.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
Why?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
You get benefits?
Slow down.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Who?
Any special reason?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Motive?
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
What?
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Yeah.
I noticed.
Six months.  Eleven days.
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
What newsletter?
Believe you about what?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They're big details, Jerry.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Come on.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
They'll trace it.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
You think it's a conspiracy?
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
A dog bit it.
Excuse me?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Only on the football field.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
What do you mean?
What do you suggest?
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Ellie...
David --
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
What?
A third layer.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
And?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It's beautiful.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
Because I can't.
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Peter Valerian.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
I'm -- I'm fine.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
If you came back.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
I can't do this --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I do.
But --
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
But --
But I made this arrangement --
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I... I... I...
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Hey, Tattoo!
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
On my own.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
No.  Not yet.
Who?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
But it's a different m.o.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
You're afraid of him.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Why should I trust you?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
Not yet.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Shut up.
Right.
Right.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
I work in the immigration department there.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Yes.
The case could be made.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
What?
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Ecru.
Oh, no, of course not.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Not even if it's something positive?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I answered these questions last night.
What if it's got a pattern?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
And did you go to the mission?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Let's try out the bed.
It's sex time.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I'm going to the store.
Are you all right?
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
So, what do you say, Let?
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
I heard about your friend.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Office work?
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
A pass.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You'll never get out of the city.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
You're there now?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I'm not here to negotiate.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Uh, no --
You want me to help you get out of the country?
How about if I call you?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
Cops?
What about the money?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
I've got a way with people.
Why haven't you turned us in?
We had a deal.
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
God, I want to go home.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Watch this.
What does arresting us get them?
I don't know.
Thanks.
Take a nap.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Then leave her to me.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You don't seem to understand.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Really?
You're not married, are you?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Let them look.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Did you see who posted it?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
We must avenge mother!
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
They make you fart.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I have to go.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
That's ancient history.
Wrong answer.
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Move in, guys.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
On my mother's life.
You a lesbo?
You did?
The Fountainhead.
Please.
I sincerely doubt it.
Thank you.
Give it up.
Without question.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
That's not fair.
Get off me.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Ben Schwarz.
German.
What do you mean?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Those are my letters!
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
What are you saying?
No.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Why didn't you do something?
No.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
He'll love it.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
And you think she bought it?
Where is she?!
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
What?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
And if I win?
Be more specific.
Shhh.
Who are you spying on?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
So? How'd it go last night?
Oh yes.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Get out!
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
You will be discreet about this?
Absolutely.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I need to talk to Annette.
Annette! Annette!
You're a lucky guy.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
What do you mean?
The Farren house
She was very pretty.
Irena.
I know that.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
But I told her to go with you.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Because she is my friend.
She's there whenever I call her!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
I've wanted a friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
This is more fun than just pretend.
But we don't have any sea weed.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
I shall wear it in my hair!
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
A lady threw it to me.
It's a pretty ring.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Don't you hear it?
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
What else is there?
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe they have to pee.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
And my bra finally fits again.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Give him the tampon test.
I looked like an Italian man!
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
Oh no.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
He's been here all night?
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Ignore it.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
No.
It's Mark.
So pay them back and apologize.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
She's just so... pathetic.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
We can just take this pillowcase.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
You are mistaken.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Iím sorry...
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
You know something about me?
Your name is John White.
That's what people keep telling me.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
That's easy.  You...
The usual...
... Alright.
No...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Soon.
Yes.
What do you mean, he's clean?
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
This is undeclared income.
I'm not sure.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
Really?   Crazy?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Certainly.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I don't know.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Hi.
We're doing our best, sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
All set.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Tonight?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
Curse?
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Ain't no place safe.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I don't think they're in school.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
I think you're sweet.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
It's better than doing nothing.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Are you going with Chet?
Yes sir.
A barbaric yawp.
A crazy madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
You have another choice.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
I guess.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
What the hell are you talking about?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Shut up!
The thieves.
Then who are you?
You hear that?
I'm not rich people.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
We can't just leave them here.
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
I'm stuck...
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
A passenger...
Nowhere...
You want some too?
She fucked me too.
I know, but...
I do!!!
Jesus!
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Yeah?
Who's got the ammo?
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Linda, what's the matter?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Right here.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Who the hell knows!
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
The shot?
Pow.
You got it.
What are you, hoping?
What do you think?
Forget Sal.
More bullets in the gun?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Right.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
What's that noise?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
Up.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Fuck you - fuck you.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
We have to talk.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Doucet killed my partner.
How do you know?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
...What are you talking about...?
Not yet.
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Take a look at this.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
What's your name?
Remember, get the seat fixed.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Jabez! Careful --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Belle --
He lied to me again.
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Guess there will, if it says so.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Anybody can see that.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
No, Stone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Afraid ... of what?
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I'm through with you.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
You really think so?
Why of course --
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Yep.
Not all of it?
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Thanks, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Hard luck -- like me.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Cup for cup!
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
I want someone to talk to ...
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
No, sir.
What does he want?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Sure.  Follow me.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Oh, yeah, I will...
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah... I know.
I know!
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Shit...
Look... who's on the phone?
Yeah... yeah!
Do you still want the operation?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Okay, give us the women.
The girl hostages.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I don't fool around with you.
I'm sorry.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Pure?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...

We'd kill ourselves.
We're not there yet.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
What?
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
Cunt.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
There are no bond certificates.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
What did he do this time?
Jade, I still love you.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
That's it?
Fifty cents.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I'm going with you.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Whew!
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
Don't worry about it.
Can ya dig it?
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Can't do.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
No rawness.
To get my money.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Later.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
We don't know nuthin' else.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Excuse me.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Come over around seven.
Would you like something to drink?
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Who's Captain Rob?
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
And he invented fire.
Yea!
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Hey, where did you come from?
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Hello, he only invented money!
I know I did.
No. Look.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Right.
So can I come along?
Oh, you're good.
You mean the lunch room?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
I know, you want go for a ride.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
You know I do!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
I reckon so.
No.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
And, take some more pictures.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
Yes.
Yes.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

I'm sorry Gurney.
Yes...
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always?
Why do they come?
It burns.
They tried and died.
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Ha!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
But maybe not.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
You met Basil Rathbone!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Exactly.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
For this one, we need $60,000.
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Would that work?
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
But Greta say --
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Isn't he dead?
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
"Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
I am.  How's your father?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Dynamite --
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
What's uncanny?
Mr. Wood!
Wow.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
What?!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
You know what would be great?
Excuse me.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Ed --
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Your brother's here.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
He made a mistake.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Well, when will she be back?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
No, I mean...
He's just ... trying a little too hard --
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Dynamite.
Right.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Oh yeah.
Why?
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Okay.
...yeah?
Where were you?
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Oh, Jesus.
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
Great.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
pierdo.
Anything wrong?
Do it!
What?
Dick... Dick,..
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
I think we've got a problem.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Tracy.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Right
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Plenty of pep, too.
That sounds good.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
I did it.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I don't believe you.
Here?
You sure?
Three twenty-five.
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
And she's super-nice
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Okay, let's say
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
So?
But other people can see them too.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Hell, good luck!
Thanks!
Sure, Tracy.
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
That obvious, huh?
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
How'd she meet Patchett?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Captain, what do you want?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
What about him?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
More.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Nothing.
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Say what?
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Answer yes or no.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
Decorated?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
Right now, before I back down.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
And Reynolds?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Yeah.  Me neither.
And no one'll know about this?
Showbiz.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
What'd he say to you?
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
I don't know what that means.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Told by whom?
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They're spooks.
I don't know what that--
No shit.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
They're here.
Fuckin-A.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Same thing?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if--
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Are you sure about this?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I'll say.
What size?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
I can't.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Not a very good one, but--
What?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
He's got his priorities?
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know, but listen--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It's a brand new card.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
Why the hell would I--
It's not?
Do you like fish?
Brill?
Why would I--
Rachel--
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
--otherwise we may have to--
My shoe?
Brill.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
You're firing me.
In your dreams.
Where's mom?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
I have a family.
It's been a few years.
The police?
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What about the tapes?
Hiding something?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
I do not.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Now.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
It's a folk song.
What?
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Don't talk.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
You too.  Good luck!
Very well.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
May God make safety your companion.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
Where've you been?
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Moose.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Aren't you?
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Candaules
Yes.  Dropping off.
Are you crazy?
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
I don't think it's indifference.
- to her cooking.
No!
What do I do?
So I follow the wires?
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
What's he saying?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
He's on to something bigger.
No you can't.
Then don't.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
In a week.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
The lipstick thermal camera?
It's a party.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Everything.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
You can do it.
What about you?
Which is--
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Because it pays off.
You change partners, you change the rules.
You damn well thought wrong.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Thought you had to use some of these.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Which one?
Jesus.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Cause of the chromium.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Where's Anna?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Lemme see it, will you?
What, you think I'm made of money?
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
That's crazy -- why not?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
They skipped that step.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Is that what you want?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
You're not gonna be there.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
What do you mean?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Have you been to the water board?
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Which number do you want, George?
How?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Keep your voice down.
What do you want, a joke?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
Thinking.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
What?
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
No ... there is another.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Right.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
What is it?
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Does Luke know?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
An Imperial probe droid.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Probably an asteroid field ....
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I'm against that.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Beautiful.
I do not!
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
No lightspeed?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Repairs ...
Yeah, you're a real hero.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
And when do you betray us again?
We have no use for your kind.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
I didn't say anything?
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
I thought you knew this person.
What did you say?!
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
My mind fills with so many images.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
We know that.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.
I like you.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Go on now. Do as I say.
Yes...
It's so good to see you again.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Where'd they go?
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Later.
We'll see.
Don't like it, don't come.
Which way?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
The freeway.
Who?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
That's not why you came.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
What is it my child?
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
So be it.
Ye...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
We still don't know.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
She is going to be well?
Never.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
No.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Why, I don't understand?
You could do it yourself...
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Are you sure?
No
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
You like it?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
You just missed them.
She seemed fine.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
I've seen it.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
In time.
Holy water.
Oh really, when?
Last month.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Why?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
Amen
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes.
Twelve.
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys.
How will he eat?
No bones?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Twenty years, Ma ...
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Frank.
It was an accident.
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
So do I.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Let's get it over with.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
I'll take my chances.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
No, you take the right.
All night?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Really.
How long you been at it?
Two hours ago!
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
You always threw up.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
What disease?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
So she's got a few sniffles.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
You're an hour and a half late.
I sing now?
Time for what?
Nine!
Uh... good.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Yeah.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Uh ...
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
What're you talking about?  They love it.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
The name's Baker --
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Frank works hard.
His kid's sick.
The Stratford.
Forget it.
Nothing personal --
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Nervous?
So how's the cat food business?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
I've given it up.
What happened to the donut king?
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Older than me.
Ever go to church?
None?
I'm not much for sweets.
Must've been after we got engaged.
No.
And you wouldn't be.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Five seconds.
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
That's your name, isn't it?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
You can't blame me for trying.
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
You always say that -- then you leave.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Why Jack?
I can see that, Alan.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
What?!
I don’t think so, thank you...
Need a nurse?
You’re a nurse?
It would help me if we were.
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
How’d you do this year, Tony?
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
I was in the city.
Because you’ll be here.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
What...?
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
That’s a big one for me, too.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
What are you sure about?
For the week?
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Are you okay, Jack?
That’s the one...
You’re not married, are you?
Jesus, Jack...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
So we'll get egg nog.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I should have done more, run more tests --
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
And you can?  Power it up?
It's easy for you to be patient.
What about you?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Dude.  That's my sister.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Hilarious.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
No...
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Yes?
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
And if it should take more time to get through --
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Then why not take it?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Well, we better get on with it.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Two in a row?
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I'm married.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
I could use a lawnmower...
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Yeah, you already said that.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Yah.
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, don't be silly.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
White Bear Lake?
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Uh-huh.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
And what about the other fella?
Yah?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
It's okay, Scotty.
Where're you going?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah.
Stan Grossman called.
OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
I know it's a lot.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
We might be innarested.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
2:30.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Ah, dammit!
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Call 'em up.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, Norm.
I see that! That's great!
Just a Diet Coke.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, I didn't...
It's okay...
Uh-huh.
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Norm?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Linda Cooksey?
So... they didn't...
Oh. Geez.
Yah.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Prowler needs a jump.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Uh-huh.
That's terrific.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well -
Well... Why don't we...
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
We're still men.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
I'll ask the questions, son.
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Should we?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
What the hell are you doing here?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Uh ... nah.
When?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Say my name!  What's my name!?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
Tyler?
What?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
No, supply oxygen?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
There's always that.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
What list?
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Strange.
What fight?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay.
Fucking sweet.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
I'm not asking you to.
What?
What's this all about, Tyler?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about Marla?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Proceed with remote detonation.
... no, no, no...
What have you left for me?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
Excuse me?
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
It's free to all.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Blow me.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
She did.
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I...I don't know.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
That's him, but... he's not here.
Right. April 25th.
Nothing is... anymore.
Let us out!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
"Next?"
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
There's the Mekong.
Start over.
Read you.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Pirates?  No kidding?
Let me see.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
You never been in one of those things.
What... whattaya do?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
How?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Can you walk?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
He's not a moron.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
No.
But..How could that happen?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Which ones?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Tonight!  How's tonight?
<u>What</u>!?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
The Little...
What's her name?
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
Bingo!
In a bar called Hellfire.
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
No.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You're playing the other side.
I hope they do.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Sure...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
No, let's go...
Where are you going?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
That's good.
No kidding.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Daddy's very ill.
Wait...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Sometimes.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Yeah, well, he's...
That's dangerous, you know.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
None.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Shut up...
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
All right, let's have a rematch.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
I don't think that's true.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
Yes.
Look at me.
Then don't go out with me.
No.  What you do today?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
I did.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
She fucks it all up!
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You said before, that he got boxes?
You sure?
Not really.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
What?
Oh, thanks.
Wonder who his supplier is.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Fletch.
Fletch F. Fletch
Ask anybody.
Yes.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Margaret.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
For sure?
Affirmative.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Yes, right away.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I agree.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
What are you doing here?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Why not?
Who?
Why don't you try suicide?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
Nothing to it.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
I'm sorry?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
God...
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Long story.
How do you know about that?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
I was afraid you'd say that.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
I would, actually.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I commend him on his choice.
This morning.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
You were going to can me, right?
Of course.
In a minute!
Oh... I have some questions.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
But I am...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Yeah, let's bury her.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
How much?
Peachy.
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Ye-ah.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Who's my real father, man?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Really?
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Fuck me...
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Julian, you're fired.
Only on a first name basis.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
What?
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Yeah?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
What happens to the schedule?
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
Des Moines.
Yeh?  Who else?
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Give who a tail?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Suspicion of what?
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Hiya, Jesus.
Darling, may I have this one?
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
You remember Mary Finelli?
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Hey, bud.
Frank...
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Queens, New York.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
This afternoon?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
When?
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Are you alright"?
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Johnny, I know, but...
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What the hell is that smell?
Better.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Cool it, Andy.
I vote for me.
Yes, man!
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
Don't do that to me!
Somebody was in here.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
In that little thing?
Stop the car!  Now!!
It was nothing.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
That's debatable.
You gotta be kidding!
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
There's no time for this bullshit...
Please don't do anything crazy.
So let's talk.
Yes.
I need to talk to you.
Look --
Look, I don't want your money!
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's very colorful, chief.
She's yours?
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Okay.
I've told you the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
Really?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
I guess not.
Yeah.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
And you'll never do it again.
We have to get off this ship!!
Nothing.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I'm staying.
This isn't a request.
I don't know what to say...
It's not that simple.
Hi, Sean.
I'd love to.
What do you mean???
Just radio for help, okay???
Big mess every time.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
That's where I peed.
Alla puttanesca.
Quietly effective.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
Then you should carry a gun.
Classic.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
We don't even like each other, do we?
He will absolutely hate it.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Brilliantly moving.
A flat-out hit.
What do we want?
See, Daddy.
What else?
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
How prominent?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
That's very lovely actually.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Joanne Bourne.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
So what are you going to do about it?
What am I doing?
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Matthew.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
hat was this morning.
Sidney.
Yes.
Oh. You know him.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little drastic maybe?
The fact is, I have to get going.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Yes.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
What was he like?
"Hell!"
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
It was one incident.
I hope not.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I would rather march.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Have you found him?
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where do we start?
You have more in common than you know.
Suit yourself.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
In a corridor.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Again?
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I was never very good at it, remember?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
Were <i>you</i> alone?
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Let's walk.
My medication.  I left it back there.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Sure...
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I see it...
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I didn't mean police.
I think you liked it with him.
I don't want to hear it.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Can we make it?
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Yeah.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Gonna knock down a wall?
Chicago.
And I keep my mouth shut?
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Well?
Why?
Christ, what...
That's nice.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
I work for him.
Yes, I do.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Brumby.
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Have another?
Yes.
Where's that?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Nowt.
Good lad.
Where you off to?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
What's that supposed to mean?
Uh-huh.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Can't say I do.
Scotch, please.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're not seeing me?
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
I'm not?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You did?
...this shit...
It is.
That's right?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
Huh.
No.
You...
Men come work for you...
Yes.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Well.  Well...
Did you?
Is that what I said?
Why would they come to me?
Why would I do it?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Do you need five grand?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Yes.
Because you listened.
What do you care...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Huh?
That's...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
Were the leads insured?
To the cops?
The cops?
Yes.
They're inured to it.
Yes.
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Levene!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Would you come in here, please?
What two?
It isn't me...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Let me...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
John.  John...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I'm out.
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
The leads are coming.
Mmm.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
I...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Because I don't like you.
Shit.
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
They took the phones...
That's right, Shel.
My wife told me to look into...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Mm.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Mmmm...
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Who did she call?
To...you know.
Of course you have three days.
Tuesday.
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I...
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You hear what I said?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Have a good trip.
They--excuse me...
The...
You closed him yesterday.
It went down.  I filed it.
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Your contract went out to the bank.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I can help you.
What position did you occupy?
 What?  You read it in the papers?
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
No.
He's the head of the family.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
 You're a good fellow.
Yeah, some deal I made.
Let's go.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
...Who?
But, you told me yourself...
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
He's an Italian?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
If I'm wrong...
I took care of it.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I know he's in Israel.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
The witness is excused; take him out.
This meeting is adjourned.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Why too late?
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
Michael.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Where can we talk?
Right here.
However I can help you...
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
When do we talk?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I thought we would meet alone.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
He supports me.
Yes.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
You will not hurt him?
Of course.  I am married still.
A homo?
Splendid.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't say?  Which picture?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Do you miss it?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Do I have any other choice?
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Thank you.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
So what do I do?
More your line.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Go.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
After you then.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
I guess.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
My monsters?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Point-five ...
Yes ... Kip ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I'm just here about my brother.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I don't think so, Detective ...
Your girl works in there ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Right ...
C'mon, man ...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
You know where the others are?
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Yeah...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
What are you doing back?
oh.
He's in some trouble ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Tuesdays ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
You've been pre-booked...
What do you say, Toby?,
I'm cool -
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
About what?
"About what?"
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
Me...
You hear me?
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
"Shadow games?"
Shadow games ...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Sure, man --
Now, we go -
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
DO IT! NOW -- !
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
Kip's in trouble
I understand -
What's wrong with her -- ?
No ... ?
Oh. Okay. Right.
Deodorant.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
The hard part ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So what's in there -- ?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You treated me like shit.
What are you gonna do?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
What are you talking about?
I got seared.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Yeah.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
That's important.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Suck my cock!
Fuck you.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Gone.
She went to Medical school in California.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
No, I had to talk him down.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Seven.
And what do you see?
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Hey fuck you.
Fuck do you want?
Of course.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
So who won the bet?
I'll be okay.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
--Gerry--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Sounds good.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
That's very presumptuous.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
How about the ones on that shelf?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
No.
--Well, maybe that means you.
Watch your mouth.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
My wife's dead.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
The wrench, why?
Don't fuck with me.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Good luck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
How many?
Bullshit.
We'll do that.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Then let's go have some fun.
Exactly.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
No.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
How 'bout you?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Short fella. Pale face.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Deputy sheriffs.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
Government.
Why ain't they more like it?
Crate fell on me.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
No, I never. What?
They never wrote you nothing?
All right, you remember the *man* then.
I don't know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Got any plants?
No plants.
I'll walk back.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Stand by the door.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
But what about this?
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
I wisht it was day.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
What do you do?
I'm Martin Blank.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Here is now there. There is here.
That's it?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Unbelievable.
I'll think about it.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
As long as I get the laugh.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
--She's not dead---
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
Other people can't.
Do you like the people you work with?
I work alone.
Okay.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Not bad. You?
Those all seem kind of related...
You're wrong. Look at his face.
I'm not happy.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
Tell them my house exploded.
Will do.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
How did you get this job?
Wow.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
That's good.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
All by yourself?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
A jogger, huh?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
OK.
It is. It's lovely.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I don't care! We'd be together.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Okay.
Doesn't matter.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Don't they believe in signs here?
I'll take care of it.
About what?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Go ahead...
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
All right. Speak to you then.
No, let me go.
Why?!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
I was there for that shot, actually.
They fired you?
Diane!
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
You know, you're a good kid.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
I know where he goes.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
How's Pilgrim doing?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Roger.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yeah, mom?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
Think you can do better?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Cancer?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Nonono, thank YOU!
What number please?
Thank you.
Real charmer.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
An accident?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
How many people in the bus?
I do.
Okay, out.
It's been eleven months.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Come on.
Then we'll be safe?
All right.
Hi Jamie.
Jamie?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
This is 132, over.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Why?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Its true, Sheriff.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
What?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
That's not true. Here I am.
Fun-ny. See you.
Lies.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
No, he's not.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Just answer the damn phone.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You all right?
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
They could be.
Totally.
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Sure.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.
Mmm?
Oh.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Yeah.
It feels like you're in France.
It depends on what way you want to go.
And you, you-you're going?
And maybe my lawyer.
Is this your first job?
Oh no.  Not at all.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Fast.
Really?!
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
And it's just in one ear?
Like what?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Could you--
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
You're out looking here?
Yes, I do.
No, I don't have time.
I'm...all right.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, right.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Lee...
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I know.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
It's on the table, Dad.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
How do you know?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Why?
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
Yeah.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh...
No--
Like what?!  What?
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Do you miss Frederick?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Wow!
Is there no chance?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
I want to experience childbirth.
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
You got it.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
I was so bored!
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Well, what about me?
Oh, well.
Oh, wow!
Where are the antihistamines?
...which I did not get.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Take our literature...
And?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Orderly.
Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You're ready now.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
That's right.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...his family has offered a large reward.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
I like Popcorn...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Starling...?
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
What'd you say, hon...?
Waal...
Give it up.
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
That, that was <u>business</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
...yes.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Spoken like a Protestant.
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I am on the track of...
Then we cannot go.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
Dottore Fanelli...
...I feel that...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
I think your condescension is even better.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Hey, don't run away now.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Like last night, Veronica?
You did last night.
All right.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
No. Hell no.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
That's good. Have you done this before?
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
No-o!
You didn't say Simon Says.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
That's three things.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
playfully shoves his hand away.
Is it hurting, dear?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
This . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Mummy!
Your wife...?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
I'm all over it.
The way you just looked at me...
Skin cancer.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
I quit. Today's my last day.
Ambrose. I know.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
What?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
In a word? Lucrative.
Never to put you in my will.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Where's my wife?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
What things do you think you've done?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I surrender...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
I got your bail continued.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Bill, listen...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
The homeless!
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Lie, you mean...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
What?
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Reporters don't have hormones?
What about?
Let's watch some TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
I think we should talk first.
Bye, Neil!
Holly -- that's not so.
Thanks, Mom.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
He wasn't there.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
We'll talk in the morning.
Just reduced.
Isn't it?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
It's late.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
What?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
What do you think?
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
How?
Your life.
What are you hoping to find inside?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know.
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
I know.
Yes -- it is.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why not?
So?
Not unless they're immortal.
On the back it has--
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
What's that next to him?
And this?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
My dreams died long ago.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The best.
Bullshit!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
It's about Mars --
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
We don't have time!
I don't eat junk food.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
What I want is to help my father.
Stop it.
I can't go without Thomas.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
He said something about a girl --
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Just one question.  Please.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Not until the man calls.
Where are you right now?
I think so.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Your phony FBI assholes.
Let me see your identity card.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Of course.
Where is your family?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Whiskey?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Why sir?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
One thousand francs.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Jean Baptiste!
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes.
Please, please try one more time.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Paul! Then another voice.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I'm confused.
And what's Steven's status?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Oh dear.
Yeah...something.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
And we get this money when?
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
I'm better than that.
Don't push it.
Most fun I've had all day.
You need to get out more.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
No...not air --
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
What --
I don't do groups.
-- the sadistic prick --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
What're you talking about?
Fascinated.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
-- it wasn't me.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Something....happened --
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
How's your arm?
By freeing them.
No it won't - no it won't!
What about all my other stuff?
Where is she?
Where is she now?
He's blessing the house.
Why?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Don't be afraid!
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Are you ok?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She's gone!
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Maura.
White meat will be fine...
What!
Why?
Good night.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Yes, they are.
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
What will he do?  What does he want?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh yeah ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
Wow.  Thank you.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Fuck you!
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
You re not thinking of going to...
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Too-do-loo, babe.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
You're supposed to be dead!
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
I was the Warden?
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Oh.  Well, what's this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Wha.....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Wha -- you don't want to know...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
You want an address on that last one?
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
If you do anything to my friend...
With a little jazz.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
A sawbuck!
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Well, I --
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
But, buddy, you were --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
But Buzz --
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yes sir...
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
No, sir.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Well... I'm for it...
Fah from it...
She sits down.
...adenoids.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
You mean a figurehead.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
It'll wait.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
I'm sorry...
Good morning.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I imagined this so differently...
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Up the organization!  Bastard.
I wasn't star--
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
So early?
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
You think I --
I'm not surprised.
It's a starting place.
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well?
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Ben.
Yeah?
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Right. Gotcha.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Nothing.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Now you are being rude.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Moisture! Moisture!
What is it?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
My what?
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
Yeah?
Sure, anything but this English.
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Hey Sandy.
Are you his girlfriend?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
What's the D.A. got them on?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Byrd's dead.
Has her books in it.
You know I remember that.
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
What are we thinking?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What is it?
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
That's a long time.
You don't know.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Yes down at the station.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Nothing if not vampires...
Perhaps...
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
That's what the one who made me said.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
I didn't realise.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What plans?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Why does he call you that?
You both did it?
And you never cried -
But how will I ever know, Louis?
You are more beautiful than any of them.
That's not so.
You want death? Is it death you want?
You've just done it -
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Sure...
Dying?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
I don't pretend to know.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
NO!!!
No...
I didn't want to kill her.
CLAUDIA!!!
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Is that bad?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Not me...no way...
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Never do that again.
You know me to well.
Fine. Show me the body.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
How much?
How much?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
And do what with it?
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
All the graves?
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
She has never mentioned her family.
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
You have forgotten my last name?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Merry Christmas.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
No, of course not.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
I know. I know.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Mother . . .
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Well, what happened to you?
Fine.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Oh . . .
Uh-huh.
Anything I can do back here?
Oh, it's wonderful.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Oh . . .
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
How's that?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Well, I don't.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Neither am I.
Well, why don't you say it?
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
About what?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Yeah, just started.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Huh?
Oh, shucks . . .
What?
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
I want to go faster!
Stop paddling!
Good.  It's terrible.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
We better go back in.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
You can't stop me.
Please.  It's my job.
Hey -- you can't do that.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Me neither.
What's that supposed to mean?
First things first.
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
So there's one around here.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
It's an island.  Got to run.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
That's great.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
When?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
Until we find something.
Power line.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
When are we going out?  You and me?
Yeah.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Brody's riding his tower.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I can get it.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
And a missing man.
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
What is it, 97 days?
Get out of here!
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Here.
Sounds wonderful.
Me, too.
What's up?
Okay.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
Make this quick!
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I'm sorry.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Get ready to go.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
She, Mister Hutton.
They still seem nervous.
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Massachussettans aren't.
Are you really?
I don't know, what else is there?
Yes, it's great!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
That?
Yeah, poor bastard.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
What the hell's there?
Oh...
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
You have a man near it?
No way.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
That bugger moves fast.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
He told me you both did....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Because....
Off....
I have work....
You caught me....
Michael!
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
You just got here....
Trying to write our report....
Why'd you come out here?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
What?
My vision is perfect....
Yes you can....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
How's Ellen?
Stop busting my hump....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Forget it....
Money is money....
Holy shit!
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
So far..
How long?
Who?
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
You don't like my voice...?
It's my fault...I have to....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Happy birthday, darling. ...
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
"Welcome to Eureka."
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
How'd you do it, old man?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
To throw out of the window.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Sure.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
It's twenty of three.
Bits.
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I don't see that at all ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No, it has a mind of its own.
No.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No.
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
I'm going back to the institute.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
No, Sir.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
You are not a loser.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Well, take care.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
-- especially one like this.
Plus, you could use that commission.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Same to you.
Easy, easy --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I think we made a mistake here.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
I'm sorry, I --
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Uh, not today, but --
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
No.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Damn right.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Gorgeous.
To the pools?
I'm fine.  What's up?
You'll lose.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
No.
Yeah I know.  I did.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Nothing.
What did you say?
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
You mean it?
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
In Costa Rica?
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Why?
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Okay.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You version of it.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Piss.
No way.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Funded by whom?
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
No.
What now?
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How am I supposed to transport them?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Could I have a tissue please?
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Look.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Small versions of adults, honey.
I know.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
No, no, no!
Like hell it is!
Oh, imperfections?
Yeah.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Yes it is.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
Kids get scared.
You're sure?!
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
What kind of opinions?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Let's get outta here!
All night.
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
What?
That was great!
No, but...
That's not true...
Yeah?
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
He's fucking nuts.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
That didn't sound very convincing.
Cute waitresses?
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Yes -- we do.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
An empty tomb?
Another one?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
I'll commit that to memory.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
You're just doing your job.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
Well, I --
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
And you ...?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
-- Listen to me --
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Eight -- and seven months.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
-- Just doing our job.
... A piece of paper ...
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Orlac is an account?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Yes indeed.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Here please.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
What about everything since?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
No thanks.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
No.
Well --
Yeah, you got to me.
Goodbye.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Why?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Don't touch anything.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You wanted to, or you are?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
Can you use these?
I believed her, Pete.
Well there's a couple --
Yeah.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Just send me a money order.
It's in the report.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Yes?
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Goodbye.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay.
That's okay...
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
No!
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Yes.  Very much.
And how did you find his work?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
And yet you fired him.
Yes.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
I...I don't know...
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I don't know, Jim...
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Yes, what?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
How many?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Yes, Holiness.
It is alright, Father.
No!
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
General Chiang.
Soon.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
It is calm.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes.
Then, we shall meet.
Two.
Tell me.
I will not go.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Good day.
Thank you.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Always.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I am braver.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
You, kill me?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Cocktail?
They don't really attack underwater and--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Hey!!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
We're ready.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
<u>Hector</u>.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Never been to Maine before?
I <u>told</u> you.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
What are you talking about?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just forget it.
Let's get away from the shore.
No thanks.
What?
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Hector.
You wanna ride in my truck?
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
I'm fine, thank you.
I can look at dead things.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I just let go of it.
<u>Apologize</u>?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
<u>That</u> was a bust.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I will... I promise.
Get me out!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Oh.
Thanks.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Why not?
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Maybe they'll catch up.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Then please - do this test for me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
The death of my father.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
No. We just -
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Did you breast-feed her?
We leave in the morning?!
Let us go, miss.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Our father? Did you see my father?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Excuse me...
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
You forget yourself!
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Fire!!!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Yeah...right...
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Can you fix it?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Just get in yours!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
You screw around like that again and--
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Doc?!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
All right...
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
...and a Russian grandmother...
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Good, you can get this under control now.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Yes?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
About twenty minutes.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
Tom, you're all heart.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Six.
How many wings have they got between them?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I'm sorry, sir.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Do whatever they tell you--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Same weight I always was.
No. You?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
So they stayed in Florida?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Maybe.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Seriously.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Eladio Cruz.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
We have a daughter.
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
And Buddy was one of them.
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
Open late.
Buddy Deeds--
And the ten thousand?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Why would I want to go there?
I don't mean Fernando.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
You got in late last night.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
He hates me.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Yeah.
I came back 'cause you were here.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Uh-huh.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Sure.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
You know who it was?
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
You heard right.
That's so cool.
Beats me.
I told you --
Death.
I can be very persuasive.
You didn't marry him for love.
Stuff?
You said you weren't with him for love.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
It's okay.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
What about Swann's miracles?
Why'd you come here?
Yes.  It's regrettable
You want more money, is that it?
Yes.
Don't bother.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Not much.
What?
Sure.  Vivovich.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
They'll never find out.
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Help me.
No.
Fuck.
You didn't try hard enough.
Try.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Who is she?
Is he the Puritan?
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
What do you do?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
I'm here for the week.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I know. I don't either.
I don't know.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
They really have to work on that street name thing.
You think so?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Oh, come on.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Do you want to- 
Yeah.
Bye.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Bye.
I don't know.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Are you sure you have to go?
Ok, bye.
It's probably trivial.
Uh...sure...I...what?
I believe in you.
I don't know.  What are they?
We're still going to be together.
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
My secretary?
It's the patient's request, doctor.
What did you hear?
You heard voices, you know you did.
I hope so.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You killed my parents.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
I'm going to look around.
Sure.
Terrific.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Oh, all that work.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
That's not it.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You sure?
You're a caterer?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
I don't know sometimes.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
They ever love you back?
What?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
So how's the job going?
Thanks, Sidra.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
What's that?
What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
Uh huh.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Your hot-ass temper.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You had four offensive rebounds.
You sure?
What'd it say?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Nobody.
You want to go talk?
Not really.
You weren't at my game.
I never asked you to choose.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Well, can you give him this for me?
Business folks.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Uh, your earring?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Sorry.  You okay?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I just told you.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
Honey.
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Great, bye.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Cynthia?
Not enough, what do you want?
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
Son, please, now....
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
This sounds threatening.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
I paid you back.
It's...doesn't matter....
He has Phil right now.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
...Lily...?
I think you have the wrong number.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Yes.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
-- fuck you.
And what did your parents do?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
No.  I said that.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You on any medication?
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
I won't.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
I'm sorry, Stanley.
No.  No.
hey.
Paula.  Ellen.
I don't.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
No they don't --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
What does that mean?
I'm trying to help, Linda --
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
mmmhmm.
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
That's it.
Thank you.
I didn't know the answer --
Alright.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
....Why does he do it...?
I have money to give you.
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
I am preparing for a ball!
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
How can I serve you in this?
He who is not with us is against us.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
But --
But why?
Why didn't you say so?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Die?  What...?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
Get out of my way.
The King killed my son!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
How did you know -- ?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Exactly why it should be given away.
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
I... we are humble people...
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
You mean shut your ass down!
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Right behind you.
Did you start out area six?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
And who are you?
I'll live...
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Only on dates?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No -
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
You must be going somewhere.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Nahhh...
Could he handle a direct contact?
Where?
How much do you know?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What's one way?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane!
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
When do you need it?
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
It's a surprise.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
You'll come by?
Yes.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Was I in an accident?
Yes.
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's not true.
Yes. Is Molly there?
Go on to the house...
My name's Will Graham. I...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
How?
And?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
What do you want?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Really?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
No thanks.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
What?!?
It's working for Elvis.
Yes, your Holiness?
Positive.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Don't believe everything you hear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Oh, God.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
An accident?!
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
He's going to pop!
Goddamnit!
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
How do you know all this?
The agents --
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
No.
Show me.
What -- what lesson?
I think I do.
Yes.
That I would find the One.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
What vase?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
They're watching you, Neo.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Because...
I believe I can bring him back.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
What the hell just happened?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Thanks.
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Let go of her.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
That means it's good.
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Can't we come with you?
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
There won't be any this week.
I could have told you that.
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
How?
No you're not...
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Get him in.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
That's nice.
Chinese food?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
What did he do?
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Yeah, so things'll be even.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Quiet please.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
I wasn't going to say --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
And that?
Red or white?
I thought you were buying my company.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
He'll wait --
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Here...
And a glass.
'Yes'.
Olympic.
What do you mean?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
'Just kidding'?
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Yours.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can't, sistah.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
You loved back?
Don' need you okayin'.
Hi, Jennifer.
What?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Love.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Has her pain abated?
I'm sorry to hear that.
No.
'To bed'?
I said get out.
I am.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
But there's so much to tell you --
Will it?
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Hold me --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Closer than that.
Good night to you, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
I guess so.
You were just curious?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What's okay?
'Spooning'?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
And I don't give a shit.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
I think you know --
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Yes, Bill.  The question.
How's that, Quince?
Yeah, I give a shit.
Hi, honey.
Drew told me.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
What?!
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
It's something.
I don't know.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I don't know, I can't say --
In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
What's the way?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

Just two. So far.							  *

Where'd you get it?
Don't say anything else.
Is that what your little note says?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
No!
How?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I'm not appealing the decision.
Shut your mouth!
I don't remember.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
You like it? Let's trade.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
From who?
Why?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.

Why would I have a gun?
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Doing...?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Two main players plus three.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Havana.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I insist.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
No.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.

What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Twenty on my man...
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Bored.
What flowers?
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.

Lotta rich women back there...
No, ma'am, I'm not.

My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
What?
I'm going to Florida.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?

Oh, Jesus!!
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
You know what I mean...
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
That's why we should do it now.
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
No shit.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Sure.
Sounds good.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
If you wouldn't mind.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I'm...
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Great.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
What?
Oh...
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Why would you lose me?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
I'm sure you're right.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Newspapers?
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Well that depends.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
And the check's in the mall.
What if I pay the rent?
Do what?
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No...
Like what?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
And then what?
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Do I?
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
What kind of help?
I didn't say that.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Ethan?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Youíre in Prague?
Who else is left?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Certainly Ethan.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Of course I can hear you.
And a lonely ass.
The Shawfish?
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
In a month.
What are you doing here?
I brought you something.
You have too many dogs.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
You are going to marry my brother?
You don't have to help me.
Stupid yourself.
What are you doing!
I was dead.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
Don't just become excited.
I'm marrying your brother!
What did you do?
I can't do that!
Awful?
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Why?
Johnny.
She was too young for him.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
You should think about this.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Where is she?
That's incredible.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Then why are you eating alone?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Oh. Right.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
We don't have a lord.

A what?
Of course.
Yes ...
What?
Course I have.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
What?
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
There are some who call me Tim?
What?
There he is!
There.
... You silly sod.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Yes, I see.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Why do you think she is a witch?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
And another!
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Listen, Alice ...
But I don't like her.
I was saved at the last minute.
Got it?
If we ... er ... 
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Quick!
Why?
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
You know nothing about her!
It's a diary.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
It's so infernally cold in here.
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
Back and upper corridors.
How will I know?
There are important papers from --
Quite.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
You are well?
I am.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Who by?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Yes.
Of course.
No, indeed.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Unwell?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
I have no idea.
What is it?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
What's the question mark?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Yeah...
I'm coming over.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
My house.  I want to try something.
Like the fractals?
Put in a quarter.
There...
Check your read-out.
Look around...
There never is.
I know.
I'm okay.
Of course I am.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Cynthia...what's going on?
Whatever.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Well, I ...
Wow!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Can you tell me what happened?
But it said #12.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Unh, unh.
Call the number.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
No... but...
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Wally Brown.
No, we don't.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
This Denny's.
Oh boy.
The one of 'em still alive?
Making ends meet, huh.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
We have to climb up that.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
I'm working on it.
First Bank ? But how ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
How long till the room fills ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Let's go.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Not quite....
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
I said NO.
Got it.
When I think you're ready.
When you are ready.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Of course.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Yes sir.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John, sir.
Better, sir.
I was.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
How can this happen ?
Excuse me, gentlemen
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
I'm fine.
Ohhhhh.
I don't think you're very polite.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Well you know what I mean.
Her favorite poet.
Was it a nice funeral?
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Have fun.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
We have a baby?
Maybe he's hungry.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
You mean, you knew about me?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Give it back Nicholas!
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
He is one of the great poets.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Just come and get it...right here!
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Here's Judy Garland!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
I don't think the color of the interior is....
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
I should do this myself.
Oh...what's that?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Oh no.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
What do you mean?
He is?
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
What?
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Yeah.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
No kidding?
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
What happened to her?
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Kiss me.
Really?
You can get the general idea...
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
What?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Why?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
What??
In the garage.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, no no....
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Why do you think she says that?
Oh.
Chocolate?
Can we look around in your camper?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Yes!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
They're just fun to read.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
If I do it, can we go?
You have no personality.
Bed wetter!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Not true.
But, I don't know how.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Just, hurry.
Would you think of me?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can't even say it.
Major.  Dish.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
Let me rephrase that...
Exactly.
He won't get mad, huh?
I just don't want to freak him out.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
That's entirely understandable.
I need you.
My very point.  Here's another one...
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
What, leaving school...
That's my point!!
... maybe it's congratulations.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
It's two weeks.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
That's little egotistical.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
What is that sup...
MICHAEL!!
Right here.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Then why are you listening to her -
What did you say your name was?
Green.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
She's going to rest now.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
He has that sign with the tree.
That's what he wants.
Okay.
Hal Phillip Walker.
ABC.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
To the bathroom.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
You must really like him.
Do you carry door handles?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
I'm not sure. Where?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I'm not sure.
Premeditated murder.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm not sure...
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
I see.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
For him?
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Depends on what I'm studying.
No, we never did that
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Who?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That's what Tim said.
Yes, I would.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
You got something you want to do?
Yeah.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
What?
All right, Mickey.
Do you miss Mallory?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Jesus...
Roger, no.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
You think so, Frankie?
Okay.
Well, what d'you know?!
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
Where was that?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
I don't know.
No. I'm new in town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How d'you mean?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
How about another beer?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
How d'you mean?
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
What happened, Duff?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Don't call them that.
He could live with us.
You still didn't answer my question.
Yeah.
We can always do that, Duff.
What the hell could you do?
What d'you mean?
There's nothing to say.
I don't think that'll happen.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Duff--
'Round town.
Like a home, for one thing.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Okay.
Going back, huh?
How 'you gonna live?
I doubt it.
It ain't in me.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Omar--
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
What's he doing to my gear?
What about McCoy?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
I find out now.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Jah guides us.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We got problems topside.
How's the ice break?
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Who?
What are you talking about?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Yeah, I know.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
Right. Right.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
You need my help?
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Five-- Six--
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A--flack jacket.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Yes, desperately.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Why do you do that?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I don't know.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
We went through the door...
Barrel.
We can handle it.
Yes.
Oh, come on Dad...
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
I'm sorry...
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
That's okay, I wanted to.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What do you mean?
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
About not finding any bogey men?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm not hungry.
Okay, I guess.
Sure...go ahead.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
I gotta stay up, Max.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Sure.
A little basic, but nice.
Nancy...
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Well, we've got --
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
I'm serious.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
We're gonna try.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
This is stupid.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm delighted.
I'm not listening.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Really?
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Really, no.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
Oh -- Okay.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Nothing.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
This is the place.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Oh no no -- no.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Right.
You and every person in this country.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Oh.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Yes.
Yes.
No!
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Still, not sparkling.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Do you ever masturbate?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
She's perfect, perfect.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Point taken.
Hi...
You want me to write down all your messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
What?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
The one down your trousers.
No, Miss Ratched...
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Right!
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Shhh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
M-M-M-Mack?
Yeah...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
What for?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
What?
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Just warmin' up.
So why are you talking to him?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I said out!
That's a dime, Martini.
Me too! Me too!
No.
Hold it!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
I'm the next one.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Boogered!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you.
Tha's your problem.
How 'bout twenty?
Bet!
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
What?
Is he in an asylum?
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Oh, yeah...
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
You're sure...
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
You are leaving, aren't you?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Because.  I know where he is.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No.  Course not.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
I brought you that, too.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I know...  It was.
What about your job?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
He fell out.
Only what?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Men have ways.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Kate.
A porco?
What?  You know him?
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Mania.
Ten billion to one.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I wish I knew.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
But my own kid bro—
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
What the hell!!!
See! You don't understand!
Why Edie, I—
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
They play pretty rough.
I better see you get there.
You training to be a nun or something?
What for?
Good. So do I.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
It's quite—  –nice.
Terry!
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Pop!
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
You go to hell.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Are you on the level, Father?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Raise a hand to me and... .
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Be sure they got enough water.
Looking for me?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
How'd you get that.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Nolan... .
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Okay.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Be careful!
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
What can we do against them?
It would seem so, Master
The moon is almost gone!
I understand, Master
There are others.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Aannnnaahhnn.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
What?!
Till they got busted.
You did work for Emil, right?
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
Love is funny.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
All you gotta do is get in.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Call and tell you.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Why you think is today?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Glenn didn't tell you?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
So you've done this before, huh?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Unless you wanna tell me.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I called your room from downstairs.
So do you.
I don't think we should get into that.
I don't know.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
You know what I mean.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
I see better with them on.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
I don't know...
Okay.  How many going out?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Any time.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Of course not.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Five point two.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
The flight?
Hejira.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, take the exit.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
Can I do what?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
I'm looking for Maurice.
Thanks.
What did you call it?
The State Theater?
No thanks.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
That's right, just me.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Are they dead?
He was that good?
Sir, I --
Where's that lizard?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
I got a half a tank.  You?
I'm out of fuel!
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I know.
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
I can't. It's all too much.
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
Aren't we a little old for that?
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Let's go down to the basement.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
I know.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
What would that be, sir?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
You don't?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
All right. But this better be good.
Doing some shopping?
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
This morning was good.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Dancing with you.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Did you break up with Charlie?
I... um...
How'd you know that?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm not burying him here...
What do you mean?
All the time.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
You know everything, don't you?
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
One hour!
Drew!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I'm not ready to die.
Don't do this, Andy.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
Except... you were gay?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Yes.
What?
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
No.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Aren't you?
How many do you know?
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Why should I?
How did you do that?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Helloooo...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Entered our minds.
Get out of our way.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
It's starting....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
What?
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
60 years ago.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
I never said I was.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
We're all on the same hajj now.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I apologize.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Blessed are the vegetarians.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
I'll see.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Don't bother
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
I want her.
Yes, I can do that.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
I don't know.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Which one?
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
But there's the doll, sir.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
You lame or something?
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
That's a nice way of putting it.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
No... I move faster alone. 
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
What are the heads?
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Indefinitely?
I haven't been invited.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He got in here how?
I'm different. I like it fine.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Absolutely sure.
Us?
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Including Killaine.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
So that I will never be found.
Magruder does.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
I've never been to Florida.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
You understand perfectly.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
There isn't anything you can do.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
Very ridiculous.
Because you think your in love with me?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
This way.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Leave that one lay.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Who told you my name?
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Information.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
A little something on account perhaps?
What do you want?
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Send that?
I've met her.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Such as?
Pretty big chance, huh?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
He checks too.
So far.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Aye.  You have a point there.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Ye have, have ye?
What are my orders, sir?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
How about your new friend?
Be nasty.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
I'm not sure I can face it.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
I'll have some of that.
Yes, please.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
He's all right, the professor.
To the airlift.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Fuck off.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Dad.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Yes.
Not yet.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I say when it's over!
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
What that?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Okay, Dad.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You know you can't win this one.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
It's been a long time, General.
Someone else will be going in with you.
Mmmnnn...?
I can't tell.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
No.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
You couldn't afford it.
Exactly.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
What are assets?
Vivian --
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Of course.  How much?
Three.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Please.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
He's good at what he does.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It was good.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Afternoon.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
What kind of school?
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
You bullshittin' me?
Okay.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Steak spoon! 
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
I will never doubt again.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
It's you.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Over the Albino, I think.
What is it?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
Well, I wasn't nervous.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Who gets Humperdinck?
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Not yet.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
We're really in a terrible rush.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Morons.
Hmm.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Think it'll work?
What?
"To my honey I'll croon,
Oooooooops!
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Right.
Maybe you're happy.
You found a flop!
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Yes.
With whom?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
We won.
Look at the picture. Please.
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
How early?
No.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
How did she pay you?
Anyone at home?
Of course not.
Now, look...!
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Casharoonie!
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
How much?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Don't you know?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
No.
She haven't even called you?
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Where's the old highway?
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Why not?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
The only girlish thing you have lost.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sam! No!
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
I'm thinking of it.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
No.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
Is your time so empty?
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Norman took a wife?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
What--special autopsy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
But where do the rats come in?
Well, news of Buckley?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
What do you think I am?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Almost certain.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
What do you mean police dog?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Day or night?
A quantum one.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
What is it, Rose?
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Don't mention it.
Am I hurting you?
I said I wouldn't.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Yeah.
But I don't know who they are.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
I do, too!
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
But how would you find him?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I think Daddy suspects.
At least.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Here comes Daddy.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
The hell we can't.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
You don't know where you're going?
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Oh, no, sir.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, sir.
Tennessee?
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She looks terrible, just awful.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
More history, Rose.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Yes, ma'am.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
You're not gonna see him again.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Stop blaming yourself.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Feeling great.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
No, we're stealing.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Bummer.
Yes, sir.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Let me see that...  Not bad.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
You think this is so easy?
I know it is, even if you don't.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Who is that... ?
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Beholden to none.
Keep 'em busy.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
I can't see.
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Hi, Han... Chewie.
We got separated.
Yeah, sure.
Leia!
Charges!  Come on, come on!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good, I hate long waits.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not fight you.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
Janet
Oh Brad.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Goodbye
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Oh.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They're all the same.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
Why?
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Don't talk like that to him!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
No doctor!
This a con?
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Ya still light seventy.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Do I have to pay juice?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What'd you say?
What?
The legs must be goin'.
Spider Rice.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Fine... That guy's great.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
Yeah...
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
What am I, Earl?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
A joker to the end.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
So's the job.
Maybe.  Why?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
No, it's not.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Of love?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
At thy good heart's oppression.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
A Plague o' both your houses.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
Of course.
Well I don't!
And I don't believe you...
I'm up for that...
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
I thought I did.
You were a soldier, were you?
Nobody's saying they don't.
Duty calls?
I'm a patriate.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Next.
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
You'll die if you leave here.
It's done.
What's that?
Nobody's going to do that!
Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You seem one to me.
Did he bring that with him?
Who else would you be?
Well I ain't a cop.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Not exactly.
Thorough man.
It's my job.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
You would have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Right now?
Something like that.
I think not.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish it!
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
None of them had any --
What makes you so sure?
I...I can't do that.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
No.
Neither do I.
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hi.
I love you too.
I'm in here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Why would someone do that?
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Hi.
Well I don't know...
No, I can't say that I have.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Yeah whaddya want?.
What?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Well you're not getting, either.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
No.  It's my first time.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
I don't need a turn!
Fine.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
No you didn't!
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
The Plaza Hotel?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
How do I know I can trust you?
Did you tell Sterling?
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Carter.
Tell me about it.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Don't go there...
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stooly.
What?
Come on!
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Yeah, it's good.
Excuse me?
I am from outa town.
The Feds?!
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Han?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
You don't understand this guy.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Or a vegetarian?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Excellent.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Really?
You can turn that finger around.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Seven-fifty.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Bob will be very happy.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Well, you do have the dress.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Okay.
Thank you, Dad.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
They're going to love you.
Even when you were young?
It's delicious, trust me.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Okay, okay.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
About what?
Definitely.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
What?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
Made for each other.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I'm not. 
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Yes.
Howard.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
It's a sign.
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
It's hard to imagine.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
You're right.  You better hope so.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
What?
Jed's got cables.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
Did not.
Did too.
Get out.
Hi.  Sam?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
What do you mean?
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Sure.  Sure.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
That's none of their affair.
The woman question?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Got to talk to the brothers.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
What's more important than sanitation?
I'm a fool.
Yes.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Alone?
Ramón -- you can't.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
You've got to help around the house!
What attitude?
What can I do for you?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
This has nothing to do with him.
What are you hiding, Danny?
It's me.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Guess it's our turn.
Midnight?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
You don't say.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Can you set that up?
Not tonight.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Why do you say that?
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Yeah, dickhead.
No last name?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
It speaks!
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
But, sir...I...I...
You writin' a book or somethin'?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
You must be a hell a shot.
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
I heard.
Where are you from, Captain?
That only leaves three.
You don't count.
What about the company?
Simpson.
You're kidding yourself.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Trust me, you're the best.
Sure, Reiben.
I'm listening, sir.
Ours is not to reason why.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
HERE THEY COME!
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Yeah?
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Frogs?
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
This evening is over.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Gee, it's easy.
I still am.
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I'll put this past my boss
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you too honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You think you know what this money is?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No, but you stole from them.
That's right, work it out.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
You will?
Yeah.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
No.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Yeah?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.  With potential.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Then don't do it.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
I know.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The truck?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Yeah.  Honey?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Are you?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
You know Diane Court?
I don't know.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
True.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know.  Soon.
Yeah, sure.
You asked for shoe polish.
That's great.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
What other point is -
Yes.
Would it do any good?
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
thought he was doing AA.
What is it?
Who is this?
You could start with an apology.
What?
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
You’re all in this together?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I think it's out of your control.
It's under control.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Until now.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
Billy had alibis too.
What are we looking for?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Whatever.
You're pretty when you're angry.
Gotta.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
..it's really about family and tradition...
She's not here right now.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Closer than you think.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Do I?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
To me Hollywood is about death.
How is that good news?
No.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Bitch.
Good twist.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Who?
Yeah.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
GALE WATCHOUT!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
I'm hanging up right now.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
WHERE?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
Sorry.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Oh...
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
She looked dead. Still does.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
I don't know.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
That's not what you said.
Don't...
Dial someone else, okay?
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Which is it?
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
I don't think you're so bad.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
Yes, that's right.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
And why is that?
She's the Scream Queen.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
Yeah.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Bye.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Come on, let's rock.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
There was a second.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
It's always been like this.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
No one yet.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Hello.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Totally unrelated victims.
Bear with me.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Oh, that's all.
And?
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
We don't know for sure...
And so what?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
How do you know all about this?
It's not what you think it is.
We need a warrant.
We have probable cause now.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
You do your job...
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
I don't know why... why now?
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
I can't do this now... please.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I don't know...
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Crime of passion.
What, Ben?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
No sir...pleasure.
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Yes, sir.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Forget it...
Never heard of him...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not no more.
Comancheros...
I've seen her...and she's alive.
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Finish your breakfast...
It isn't fair...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
Come on, say it.  You know...
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
Does this dog here belong to you?
Do I look like it that much?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
And the title of this piece?
The title won't do.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Every word.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
I have to get back.
Oh--I am him too!
Can you love a player?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
And that was only my first try.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Mr. Henslowe?
There is time. It is still dark.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Write me well.
My lord.
But why me?
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
My hat?
I . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
You're a bad loser.
No.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
They know.
So I gathered.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's all?
Yeah.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
So?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
David?
You were magnificent.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
It tastes different.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
That's what I thought he said.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Of course.
No.
Yes. They're my friends.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
It's a breeze.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
I write about it?
Yes.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Don't you like her?
Who?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
I just thought you'd like to know --
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Why not?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Gee, that's very serious...
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I don't want to talk about it...
What?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
What're you doing later?
Right now, I just don't care.
Are you in love with her?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
No thanks.
Gee, this is great.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.
I am not like my mother!
Great.
Wonderful woman.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right, that's right.
They are?
You do it.
I don't know. Probably not.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You're a genius.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
Sammy's?
-- do you want ice?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
So I'm saying it...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you know better...
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
What's gonna happen?
Well, like what?
No shit?
Fine. How are you?
How?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
George?
How did it go at the bank?
Go where?
Great... can we talk later?
Your advice!
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Television or movies?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Yes.
Does it make you happy?
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George...
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Sure.
I know what you mean.
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Layered?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it.
What about Jackie?
Lester, it just happened.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I'll call you back...

No you won't.

You do?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
No kidding? Your own shop?
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Aren't you going to have one?
No.
Why not?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Oh yeah?
Who is that?
So what's your point?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Nothing.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Didn't you have any panties on?
Sure.
Sort of.
Well... sure...
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
No... how long did you say?
Where to, Les?
Yes?
I'm hungry.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
No, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
Try to think what it was.
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Okay.  You behave yourself.
No.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't, Mom.
Are you having a bad dream?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Yes.
Of course you are.
Wendy give me the bat.
can of itself be a problem.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Fine.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I told you!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Oh my! 
Yes, Betty?
Chops?
Am I?
That man -- who is he?
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Um, I don't really know this one...
A bunch of real mama's girls.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Sing!
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Right.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
And all those like you.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
A what?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
Useless distractions.
Your cell is more than adequate.
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
Mary Clarence!
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Saving you.  Move!
I'm a Christian.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Think again!  And get out of here.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Really?  Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.
What?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Yeah, like what?
Maybe. 
What's the problem?
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
That should have tipped us.
Yes?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's kind.
Yes?
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Excuse me?
I was afraid of this.
To place it inside its coffin.
Your superiors are two days away!
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
Well... that might be... helpful.
Chosen me?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
Listen.
What happened?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
I know.  Hold on.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
It would be interesting to find out.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
I have not been able to face him yet.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
His horse.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
I can show exactly.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
She has confessed.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
No sir.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
What's all them books?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
A boy or girl?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
It was fun, anyhow.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
Huh?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
You better go get your things.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Okay.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
I didn't mean that.
Will he be supervised?
And what are you, his chaperone?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
American literature. What else?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
It's kind of overwhelming.
How old, kid?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Uh, better make it one.
Anything good?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Eighteen and a half years.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Where to?
Yeah, like what?
Lovely.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
What difference does it make?
And how much are these?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
It'll cost you five bucks.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
It was just a thought.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
And have you mended them?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Yeah, that's right.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
The inspiration.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
Well?
It wasn't my fault.
Lettuce and tomato?
Oh, yeh?
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
...but he found you.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And the last...?
Tht was summation, Your H...
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Not in those words.
That's all he said.
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
It's entirely mutual.
A what?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Down, Daphne!
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
Me?  After Sugar?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I may spill something.
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Come on, Daphne.
Oh yes, we do!
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
You like it?
I thought you said three years.
We could -
What's with him - he drinks?
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
Goodbye?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got to be under twenty-five -
No - funerals.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Afford it?
That so?
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Who are you?
Now, really -
No, my flag steward.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
You don't say!
Shells?  Whatever for?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Completely.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Complete washout.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Have you ever tried American girls?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
I cut myself shaving.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
But I’m not taking your name, buster. I’m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Your probably best off pretending you’re asleep.
Last night?
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
I had to say something to get you here.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
I’m compulsive and weird?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What is?
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Ahoy!
Hard.
What's his name?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
She was dirty and wet...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
NO! N-O, NO!
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Yes, sir...
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David!
Goodnight.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Whatcha got there?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Yeah, just stay where you is...
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Help yourself prickfuck!
I don't know.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Oh no, it's that kid.
Mrph mprph!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh... Bacon.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Kyle, check it out.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Yeah!
YOU BASTARD!!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Right away, ma'am!
What the hell is going on?!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Don't call me dumb!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
My friend the clitoris told me.
Check.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
It certainly is.
I'm sure I will.
I did nothing to the monitors.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Look answer my question!
I can hardly wait.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
What is the condition of the bridge?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
I know, I know.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
No...
You too.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
You're not from around here, are you?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
It was a clearance.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
What about bowling?
You're a scumbag.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
What if he wants to get out?
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Where can I find him?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
What do you want with my dad?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
No, not at all.
So, what about you?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
We would have sooner or later.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
He's dead Sheila.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Back away then.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
But she's --
He's right beneath us.
Norman, don't do it!
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
What do you need me for?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What do you mean, he's missing?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
Damn it, Edmunds?
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
Jerry?
Pull it.
They're coming.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
In a minute, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Still clear.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
You think I'd really drink that?
No, he isn't.
You're insane.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Shut up and open the door.
How far away's the sub?
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying.  There.
No idea.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Do you?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
You've heard of me?
Like what?
You mean a picture?
I'm not sure.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Could I learn to feel it?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Send one squad up.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Was this trip really necessary?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
It's automatic.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I got Games & Theory.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Zander, please... Let's go !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So ?
I don't know, Zander.
Who ?
I have good reflexes.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
I can't help it.
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
What happened to your eye ?
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Hut... hut !
You're the best.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Teenagers !
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Keep trying, Sergeant.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
What's going on, Diz ?
Yes, sir !
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
That is how V'ger will survive.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain... I'd like to go along...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Decker....!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
We're ready, sir.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You haven't heard of it.
It's about life.
I live there.
Mmm.
Mister White is...
Cast stood me up.
Paperclip?
You have to sign for it.
You going to ask me in?
Oh.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Sure did.
Hi.
I'd love to.
Not without a rolltop desk.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
After Drama Group.
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I've been thinking.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
How old are you?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
Thank you.
I, uh...  Um...
Why?
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
No, no...Please.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
...I...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You were in the car with Bob?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
He should be put in jail.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
Not now.
I can only write on a manual.
Um, no.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
It's lovely.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
So we just got lucky.
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
I bet.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Yes.
Good.  That's very good.
And this is my room so get out!
That's so weak.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
I have lava.
Where are you, anyway?
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Every day.  More and more.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Not to me.
Don't do this.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
To make it easier for them or you?
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
She was angry at herself.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Nobody likes a snoop.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
No.
It's the same choice you made.
Feeling the pressure?
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Give 'em my number.
Oh please.
No, there isn't.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Not yet.
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
I needed some time away.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Restless.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Hey. What's up?
You know...Stanley...
Thank you.
Yes.
Four brothers and five sisters.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Speak English.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Got a lot of homework?
Is everything OK?
Huh?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Thanks.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Ni...
...gger.
Again!
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
OK.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Three.
Yeah?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Doubt it.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
She's as good as gone...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Richter-we got a problem!
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
If I don't get power up we are!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
At his office in the Capitol.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
General Schmuck?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Yes, sir.
A shooting war!
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're right, sir.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
I see.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think they would cheat?
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
What the hell is Plan-R?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
How many planes did we lose?
What's the target.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
War.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Look, can't someone help me?
They're moving apart.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
What happened?
Then get off my back!
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Sure, King.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
I don't anymore.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah!
It's really not about anything.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No.
No, I'm not worried.
Sure.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
What?
Hey, man.
What?
Tim...
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
I will.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
It's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Please.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Come on. Inside.
A Porsche.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
I'm not a nice guy.
Funny shit, man.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Nobody. Sooze.
Sooze wants to see him.
Ask your girlfriend.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I hate that.
Man?
It's a piece.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
About things that are important to me.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Hey!
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
So what do you wanna do?
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
No, I don't.
You do.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah, really.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Well, what about this?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look at you!
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
I'm always serious.
I'm moving.
Mm-hm.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Me?
I think I gotta go.
About what?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yeah.
I'm here.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
I sure do.
Mmm-hmmm...
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
That you?
Ammo?
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Bank branch!
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
What has Artie to do with it.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
What were you -- a child actress?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
I don't want it now.
You bet.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
We've missed you too, dear.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I don't know.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Cut away from me?
Okay.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.

Come here!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
The other guests?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Good.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
What car?
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Yes, Madame.
You know better than to interrupt me.
This is the staircase of the palace.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
But where?
But what will happen?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Later.
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You love me?
Tell me where I can find her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
We can't do that.
What do you feel about me?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Like turning off a light.
I sort of like what you said.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Well, just one.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
How do you know?
I can't help it if men notice me.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I know.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Brad?
Clark.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Too much mayonnaise?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Anyday...
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Say!
Mmmmm . . .
What kind?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
KRYPTONITE!
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
What do you want?
A computer.
What will it do?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
I didn't have my camera with me.
Thank ...you.
You just did, with that great dinner.
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Missing????
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Who needs Gus?
I do?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Everything on it.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Good. My heart can't take it.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
I think he said a "curl."
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
My kind of people.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Yes?
Don't worry, I've got you.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Lacy. . . I . . .
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Superman gets mail here?
An angle?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
First, I have fun.
What do you fear?
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
We're running out of smoke.
Got it? Otis?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
North. It's north
I will.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Oh.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
Is that what they're calling him?
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Even that would be an improvement.
Tough guy, huh?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I'm going to bed.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
And if I don't obey?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Lara, please...
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He is. Usually.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
It's not bad.
Sure.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Which one?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Billy, that's too early.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
They can look forward to that.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
From what?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Yes.  He does.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
What happened to summer?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
That's what he said.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
What, Mason?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
You seem very sure about that.
Thank you, Nicole.
What do they do?
News?
I tested positive.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
No.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
What time in the morning was this?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Positive.
Of course.
Pretty slick, eh?
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
No.
There's talk of that.
But Charlene...
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Hitler!
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Why, has he bothered you before?
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Not just this minute, J.J....
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Are you finished?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
How?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
What kind of an act is this?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I'm used to you...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Like you?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Steve, stop it please...
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Those lying motherfuckers!
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Can I stop by my house?
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
And what it that?
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Open the goddamn door!
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
I'm Steve. What's your name?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
What's in those files?
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
How?
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Von der Null?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
How could I know what's in the archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
They said I was dogged?
Like this bandleader.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
All.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Hot dogs?
Good fighters.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Like shit, boss.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Please, don't do that...
Oh, no... you.
Don't just stand there, get help!
Alright... okay...
If there was one.
Yes... well...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
It's okay, dad.
Wha... ?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
Nicholas...
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Shut up!
Let me show you...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Stop it!
I have to show you...
I didn't know what else to call you.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Boyfriend?
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
How do you mean, exactly?
Okay... okay.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Yes, very lucky.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
We provide whatever's lacking.
May I make two suggestions... ?
It's all down to this...
The key?
No, you didn't...
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
I'm just like him.
Did you worry about him?
I know who she is.  Take a message.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Just stay there, Nell!
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
You don't believe in the paranormal.
All right...
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Yes.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
How'd I know it was for you?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I don't know, you know...
-- What do you think?
I don't think I want any.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
We all did.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
What kind?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Let him break - he likes to break.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
I only asked.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
What?
One thing I need.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
You just cooking then?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
No, but I know what he means.
Hard to miss.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Right.
Have you ever known me not to be.
What do you think.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Who remembers.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Eh?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Where is he now?
Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Where else?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Something's on.
What?
Walked.
I miss my kids.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Go now.
Ah.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Who?
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Uh-huh.
I don't understand.
Way out of line.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
All right.
OK.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
I, uh... thanks.
Yeah, right.
How's that?
How are you?
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
He and Doris... were having an affair.
I don't know. I don't think so.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
Sure you don't need one?
He a good man?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
No thanks, honey.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Jesus...
Whuddya mean?
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Birdy...
Crane. Ed Crane.
We're just closing, friend.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Great.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
I'll go down and speak to him.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
Let's go!
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You said the system couldn't fail!
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Whose footprints?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Correct.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
I think I should come with you.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
I'd say we're in its home.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
I don't believe it.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Get back!  Now!
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
How about lunch?
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
What happened?
I don't understand.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
What's to see?
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
A window onto the human condition?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Shhh!
Oh, yes.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
It looks so small.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Well, thank you for your help.
Were you there--how do you know?
I'd ask for identification.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Evidence of what?
Nothing completely conclusive --
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
What?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I think they have that covered.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Where are you, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
All the equipment is brand new.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
This is great. This is fitting.
Very weird.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
Well, call General McAddie.
About what?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
I don't know.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Yes.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
How?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
I do it all the time!
I'll be fine.
I don't need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
As far as I needed.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Then what is he?
I can't leave him!
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Already there.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Sometime yesterday morning.
Dr. Kent.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Considering where I've been...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
Oh, yes, yes.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
His own doctor?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
They're forged.
Silly looking bunch.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Well you read this.
I wish I knew.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
I'll put these flowers in water.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Why are you lying?
Of course.
It's true then?
They'll be returned, miss.
Thank you.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
This is where he vanished.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Who?
I told the police.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Why not?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
I understand...
What's he saying?
You saw it?
I am not a bad man.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Not when I get interested.
Where are you staying?
Okay.
Yes?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just five dollars, please.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
But he has been there, off course.
Two.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
What??
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Disease? What disease?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
What'd you say?
I'm stealing it.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
How would you kill him?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
What??!?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Explain it so I can.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
Get the fuck away from me.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Fine.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Who told you that?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Here...
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
What's that?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Leary?
Obviously.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Valentine...
What?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
What kind?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
That idiot!
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
What does that mean?
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
He's training.
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
... For the mermaids.
Well... about everything.
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
You say that because you have the title!
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I didn't dive.
You go back, I'll walk.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
In my apartment?
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
Again?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
In the spring when he melts!
But... how is he going to breathe?
Why is he doing this?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
What's your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
What's up?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
Keep going.
Mordechai!
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
He's still working out some identity issues.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
No, it was the perfect level.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Why not?
Good looking?
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
I don't know.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What, senorita?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Yes.
Absolutely sure.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
When will they be back?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...We’re turning in circles.
Something like that?
Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
I’m fine standing, thank you.
By your Austrian?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn’t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Yes... Good, good...
Where is he?
How many of you scumbags are here?
Where is it?
Got it. Puppies.
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
La what?
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
I hope it’s not too significant.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Yeah.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Shut up!
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
... No.
How’s the boy doing?
What about his girlfriend?
Où est passé ton salon?
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Fuck...
Three...
I can only tell you what he told us...
What sums?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Majesty, I can't...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Better today than tomorrow.
Well...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
God defeated the English, not me.
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
Who are you?
The English??
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
How old are you?
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Yes.
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
... as always, majesty...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
If there was, I didn't see it...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Good.  Where are the English?
Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
No... not like this...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Never look behind -- only ahead!
But my voices... they promised me...
I... submit to Our Lord.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
It's not possible...
Playing...
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
What signs?
So your memory's coming back?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Really?
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Let's see.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Who wants me to stop?
He's still a doctor.
Dead.
What's happened?
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
I know.
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Cow!
You made contact?
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw.
No, I don't think so?
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
To be deaf?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
There is something to be said for silence
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
I'd like to make a swap.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
No.
Everyone has to practice.
He chopped it off
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
All right if I look around your lobby?
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
He'll probably fall down.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
You think my play is bad?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
We cleared 22 here.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
Which one?
Mottola.
Who's got the contract?
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
You sober?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
Neither are we.
Let him wait.
No, not a thing.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
No.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Yeh, sleepin'.
All right, when?
Yeh, he knows that.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Get on with it then.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You got a system, Carver?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
We missed him.
I think he will.
He was?
Of course.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
You better take a drink.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
You hand that over to the police.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Why don't you try him again?
I've got to see you alone!
Where did you hit her?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
She could tell you where father is.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'll have to try to remember.
He did!
Tell 'em.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
All right.  All right.
So I see.
Don't you remember....
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
What did you do with the rest?
Yes?
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Is Julia going with you?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
That's all right.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Who is she?
We need ice.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
You must admit I have good taste.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Wynant's body?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
What are you going to do?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
How did you get in here?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Home?
Y-yes.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
What do you figure it to be?
I heard!
Maybe I do.
Why'd he come in our camp.
It's a combat action.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Knock it off!
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
Oh, that's fun.
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
...I know.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Stay low.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
You sure you want me too?
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Probably.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Is that good, or bad?
With what?  Against how many?
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
The photos.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Now you need me.
For real?  A treasure?
Naw, nothing.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
What?
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Oh, Jesus!
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
We have to do something.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Violation?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
What?
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
You don't know.  You don't....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
What?
Where's LUH?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Look more closely.
All right...
Where's LUH?
Yes.
Damn.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
You don't have to talk about it.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
What do we do?
Stay to your left.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Taylor's dead.
I know. I warned them.
Security.
But sir--
A ticking bomb...
What about the ballistics report?
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
What?
I thought I told you--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Yes.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Um-hum ...
Just a second.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Disappointed?
The pepper, too?
Right.
The six--
But it's not enough!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
Peaches and cream.
Make it out to cash!
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
I'll be delighted.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Good night.
Like that?
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
Then why do you want to go?
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Divine ...
Lovely.
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Naturally not!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I beg your pardon!
But you're the more intelligent one.
Well, he was in the navy.
That's right.
The pumps --
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Jack.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
What did you want a gun for?
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Nice lines--
Yes--
Good-by.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
When?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
Who with?
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Swell!
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
What'll I say?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Sure.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
I thought I put you to bed.
I was never stiffer in my life.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
What for?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
He's all right.
--you'd go with him!
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
It all depends on what you're used to.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Oh, so that's it...
Not now.  I don't have time.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
But wait, you don't understand-
In pace requiescat.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Never got to wear one of those.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
How is he?
Where do you get these questions?
Room service.
Fortuitous even.
Wyatt...
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Yeah?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
That a fact?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I'm on my way.
I see.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
And still not a thing to watch.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Is this another one of your games?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Gone fishing.
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Happily.
You too.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
He's killed closer.
Up.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Yes, M.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
What do you make of all this?
Sabotage?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
No -
What's wrong?
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
You have to leave -
It's Bond!
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Why in the h...
Go back to sleep.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I will appreciate that.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
I'll be right there.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
I already have, my dear.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Whadda ya think?
Where was the last place you left him?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Shhh!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
But why would Andy want me?
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
How 'bout three out of five?
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No, no, no, wait!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Last present!
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Can you move over a wee bit?
In my pocket.
Did you now.
So had I.
Juliet who?
You're late for breakfast.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
Nine thousand dollars.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I was just waiting for the right time.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
That's frustrating.
This is different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Helena --
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
You can't make me.
Not like.  It is.
Yes, mom --
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
Arizona.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
That thought makes me feel awful.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
If I can.
Everybody has a weakness.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Like you protected Landry?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Christ.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
What's your name?
Too young for what?
What? Steady like?
Happy birthday.
What happened?
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Fuck, OK.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Have you got any gear on you?
Yeah.
Right.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
Yeah.
It was my fucking television.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
So?
But you don't have the money?
Why, thank you.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
That's fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
It will be your chariot!
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Rescued at last.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
A Federation starship.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Let us explore it together.
The power was within you.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
Why?
I did not.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
He did have pointed ears.
A "t."
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
The ship needs its Captain.


I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Are you embezzling?
I don't get it.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
I'm sorry -
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
If you think -
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Wrote the...?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Come here.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
We have to.
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
It's something Users do.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
But you didn't.  Why not?
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes sir.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
Answer the question--
I don't take those assignments.
What?
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Fuck you.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I'm married!
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Hello, Alabama.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I'd love some pie.
At the movies?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
So he really loved her?
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
My pimp.
Is he nice?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Really?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
That rhymes.
I don't blame you.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I know.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Where?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No. Not yet.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I really don't know.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Do you still have friends on the force?
Do tell. Why drug related?
I give up. Who are you?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
On their honeymoon.
Do you believe him?
Or a bit player -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Exactly room-mates.
You're right. It is.
No.
Uh, what?
You're still a little... disoriented.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Do you know why you're here, James.
What year do you think it is?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
What's the matter with your leg?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
You... you left them a message?
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
No, thank you.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It will.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Time.
Just a car.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
No charge.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Sheriff Potter.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
What does it look like?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Did you like it; me watching you?
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
Lift me down.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
No.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
Where are you going?
Just drive.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Someone will find me.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Wait a second--
I do.
What makes you say that?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
What are you babbling about?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Will you shut up!
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
You expect me to believe that?
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
That's 'cause he's dead.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Stand up.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I'm her husband.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Accident.
Live there?
I was hoping we could talk.
About what you said this morning.
I'm not rambling.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Open up!
You got the money?
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That's all right.  I got it.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
Where'd you learn to do that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Lift me down.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
No.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Walk away.
Don't feel like nothing.
You'd never understand.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
What do you mean?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
You already have.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Get in.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Where to?
How much?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
I think I burned my gun hand!
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Four.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh.
Rust?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
We're supposed to be honest.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
But not a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
There's nothing to do.
I lied.
You're secret identity.  That man was right.
Fine.
Was your family traveling with you?
No.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Advances?
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
She back in Kansas?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Oh.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
He admit it?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
But he was called...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Huh?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He got the boy's horse.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Yeah.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Yeah.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Yeah?
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
That ain't what I mean.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Hell, yeah.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
They just said they wanted time.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.
Umm ...
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I don't want to know.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Never heard of him.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Mr. Soze will be most -
We want to meet him.
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Where?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
Wait a minute.
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I said I never heard of him.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
I knew him. He would never -
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
As far as we know, nothing.
Four cases in three years ...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
We went to Code Blue...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
That's right.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes...I...yes.
Yes.
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Overruled...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work.
Yes.
What is that to you...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
I can't talk now.
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
We got to talk.
... I know.  I went ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
What?
Hi.  How are you doing?
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
But you knew about this.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Your name. And --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Salina, Kansas!
Then will you for me?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No.
Please! And don't look at me.
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
No, it's all right.
But why? Why here?
We're going up the tower.
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Oh! Yes! Here!
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
My name is John Ferguson.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
How can you be sure?
Knowing I have to die...
And no birds sing.
No.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
What?!
...somewhere in the light.
Would you know the room?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm here, I've got you...
Yes --
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Madeleine!!
How long has she had the room?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
What's tomorrow?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I know. Everybody tells me.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Carlotta?
Did you need it?
Oh?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I didn't hear you.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Playing?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
It's sacrilegious.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Any time fat boy!
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
It has to be done.
What.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
What does that mean?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Call 911.
Good God...Good God...
What?
I said, what have we done?
What?
I don't know...
You have a King fantasy.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
They need leadership.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
You will not screw this up.
How about my Fatburger?
You forgot the tent?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What are you talking about?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
You expect more what?
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Of course.
Not padded ones.
We're leaving in three hours.
Well I do.
Just a bit of organizing.
I'll see you tomorrow...
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Move the bodies.
But...
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Pup corn?
...embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
Two.
Are there many windows?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Yes, sir. Good night.
What's the matter?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Yes.
That's fifteen by seven?
He was asking for it.
Why the bad temper?
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Is she coming back?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
All right, Mother.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I've seen worse.
Where's my gun?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Not from in here.
What did you find out?
I'm still making adjustments...
As a matter of fact, I do.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Start of what?
Authority still makes me nervous.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
<u>Hello</u>.  What?

Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
Wilfred, that's not bad.
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Come on.
No, no, no...
...the Harvester... 
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
....we landing?
The American "people"?
...you want us to go to War...
What do you know about them?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Due in Nashville.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Quite touching.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
...what is this?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
To preserve their Way of Life.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...

No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
Watch me.
Take ten.
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
...what is this?
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Thank God this is America.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Why a beret?
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Yes. 
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Please, no thanks... 
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
What if he asks where I got the money?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Upper West Side.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Big deal!
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
YES!
I know that.
I started seeing things.
No.
What do you think I should do?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Toward the end.  You remember?
The wives.
Um...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You got it.
This.
Shhh.
It's alright.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
But Claire--
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
What are you going to do?
I guess not.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I don't know...
It's Saturday.
How is it?
After that.
I'll be there.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Wow.
Well, that's nice.
No.  Look!  In the window.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
When?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
That's not what I'm sayi--
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Who?
I'm not going to listen to this.
Do you know it?
You don't have to do that.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
But you've not told Michael.
Two heartbeats.
Every day  twice.
I want to see my mother.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Then you wear it.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
You're a monster.
Stop it!
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
Do not tell me that!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
I love Michael...
Leave me alone!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
And whose houses do you design...?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
No.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Why should I?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
What's this all about?
No worries
Don't worry about it -
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Maybe he got promoted.
Perv.
Check it out!
Give me those!
I love those springy head puppies!
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
But that smile.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We love our lives just the way they are.
You're way ahead of me again?
I will not have my boys arguing.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
What do you want me to do?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
My new bike.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
I miss them, too.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Your article sucked.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
He didn't. He had it built.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
And then what?
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Well? Where the hell are you?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
I'll make you very proud.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
I have only one concern...
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
What kind of ideas?
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
It's about your parents.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Take your time.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Then what?
You're telling me you believe the guy?
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Where's Lombardo?
Why is that?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Lombardo ever come out here?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
What's that supposed to mean?
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
That's right.  That was his name.
Yes.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Are you mad at me?
That was the same thing Ray said.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Try what?
Aha?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Uh... how long ago was this?
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
I adjusted it.
There's only seventy-eight.
Of course not.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
Yes, me!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
My... the wild west.
Yes sir.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Philistine.
They're coming.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Yes...?
You are very important, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't believe you.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Willow!
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Ahhh!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
He never misses.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Why not?
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
The sorceress.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
They're Amish.
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
Are they going to kill you?
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
I was wrong.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
How long?
What else can you do?
I'm coming.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I don't know where he is.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Yes.
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
I have?
Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
How did you guess?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Yes.
Did they hurtcha?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohhhh --
They would?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh --
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I don't know.
Oh, you did it yourself!
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
NO!
To Oz?
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Yes -- ....
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
I could come for a second opinion?
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
And now it’s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Renard.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Consider me ungrateful.
I’m sorry.
Partially, yes.
No.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Oh James.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Of course...
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Because --
Cured, yes.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
What are you up to?
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Everything's changed --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
I don't know their real names.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I'm from L.A.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Viktor! Stay the course.
I thought that was in detail.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Is this what you're looking for?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
... until he found tungsten.
We all do.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
By reading my thoughts?
Were you now?
What do you say?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
To find Rogue.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
A piece.  Only a piece.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
You have the wrong house.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Hello...?
Of course.
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
That's a tough choice.
Fron kon steen!
Yes, sir.
Vermicelli.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
But, sir...
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I thought you wanted to.
Fro-derick!
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
How?
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
... I'm glad that's...
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Act casual!
How do you know it was a 'he'?
... It's.

It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
And look at this, Doctor!
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Not fooling around.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Food!
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
